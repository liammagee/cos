<h2>ACCOUNTING FOR SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to <em>Circles of Sustainability</em>, an adaptive system for building dynamic reports for sustainability projects.
    The system is currently in <em>beta</em>, and we welcome any comments or suggestions.
</p>
<p>
    To build a sustainability project report using the system:
<ul>
    <li>Define a project</li>
    <li>Conduct a general assessment of the project</li>
    <li>Create a series of issues and objectives for the project</li>
    <li>Choose one or more indicators to measure each issue</li>
    <li>Check whether all sustainability domains are covered by indicators</li>
    <li>View (and possibly refine) the project reporting template</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    The sidebar on the left shows your progress through these steps.
    The panel on the right will show suggestions and options as you proceed.
</p>
