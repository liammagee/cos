            <p>This report is the result of the collaboration, efforts, and insights of a number of people.</p>

            <p>The Centre of Expertise for Urban Programming provided the initial impetus for the review, and a number
                of staff provided invaluable support in the design and logistics of the review. In particular we thank
                Joyati Das and Remy Herbert for their constructive advice on the Urban Meta-Analysis Framework.</p>

            <p>In South Africa, Lindokhule Ngobe and Sibusiso Mabusela co-ordinated the qualitative interviews, and
                proved invaluable guides to the context and complexities of Orlando East. Our review would have been
                impossible without their support. Liveson Manguwo offered tremendous support in the development of
                interview instruments, as well as in conducting and analysis of the interviews themselves. Portions of
                this review are also indebted to his report written shortly after the interviews <span class="citation">(Liveson Manguwo 2012)</span>.
                We also acknowledge the assistance and insights of World Vision ZAF staff, and in particular thank
                Tirhani Manganyi for her support during our visit. Students from the University of Johannesburg’s Social
                Anthropology and Development Studies Department helped with note-taking, translation, compilation and
                interpretation of interviews<sup><a href="#orlando-fn1">1</a></sup>. Their time as well as their
                enthusiasm is highly appreciated. Finally, we thank the many community members, partners and staff who
                participated in interviews, sharing their views with great candour and integrity.</p>

    <h1><a href="#orlando-executive-summary">Executive Summary</a></h1>

    <p>Six urban pilot projects launched in 2008-09 have formed the core of a World Vision evidence base for urban
        programming innovation and approaches. The pilots are based on principles of action- learning and operational
        field research - ‘letting theory emerge from practice.’ The ‘meta analysis’ of urban pilot projects commenced in
        FY13 as a priority of the Centre of Expertise for Urban Programming (Urban CoE). The purpose of this exercise is
        to formalise and share what the Urban CoE has learned about working in urban settings, compare this emerging
        knowledge across diverse urban contexts, and determine implications for programming and funding models.</p>

    <p>The pilot project in South Africa, which began implementation in September 2010 and exists now in the second
        project phase as the Khuthala Orlando East Urban Project (FY11-14), was the first of the pilots to be reviewed
        as part of the meta analysis process. This report details the findings of the review exercise, conducted in
        November 2012.</p>

        <div class="section level2">
            <h2><a href="#orlando-methodology">Methodology</a></h2>

            <p>The starting point for the review methodology was the Urban Meta Framework (UMF). The framework was
                developed at the beginning of the pilot process, and consists of key urban themes, questions and
                indicators to be explored in the six country contexts. The UMF was used to inform baseline studies in
                the pilots (including Orlando East), thus providing data for comparison at the time of review.</p>

            <p>The UMF was tested as an evaluative framework for the first time in Orlando East. The urban themes
                therein were translated into a set of indicators and instrument questions in three surveys targeting
                community members, project partners, and World Vision staff. A total of 27 semi-structured interviews
                were conducted applying these instruments, which included both qualitative and some quantitative
                questions. In addition to this, a quantitative ‘partnership assessment’ questionnaire based on a
                VicHealth tool<sup><a href="#orlando-fn2">2</a></sup> was trialled in a small number of partner
                interviews.</p>

            <p>Results were analysed by identifying prominent themes, using online software called <a
                    href="http://www.dedoose.com">Dedoose</a> (qualitative research analysis software).</p>

            <p>Limitations of the methodology, covered in detail in the full report, include the limited available time
                and small cohort size for interviews, the difficult of translating a generic framework and questions to
                a specific local context, the broad scope of surveys, and the variable accuracy and quality of
                notes.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that it was not one of the objectives of this review to conduct a full impact
                evaluation of the Orlando East project. It was determined early in the planning that the project was not
                in a position to be evaluated halfway into the second phase of implementation, and that this would
                complicate the first review–primarily because it was as much a test of the UMF as an evaluative
                framework as it was about learning from the pilot itself. A blending of the objectives and methodology
                of impact evaluation with UMF-based learning will be tested in the second pilot study in Cambodia from
                March 2013.</p>

                    </h3>

                    <p>The review found a wide range of contextual factors influencing the project goal of ‘contributing
                        towards local economic development through partnerships and community engagement in wards 29, 30
                        and 31 in the City of Johannesburg by 2014.’<sup><a href="#orlando-fn3">3</a></sup> Upon
                        analysis of the themes emerging from interviews, it became clear that these factors–though not
                        specifically ‘economic’ issues–were nevertheless significant obstacles to the realisation of
                        local business or employment objectives.</p>

                    <p>Drugs and alcohol, crime (‘lawlessness’), and the prevalance of HIV and AIDS were all noted as
                        significant social challenges. Stakeholders in Orlando East were also highly critical of
                        government, complaining variously of corruption problems, perceived inefficiencies, and a lack
                        of transparency and accountability in the conduct of government. Perhaps not surprisingly,
                        government-related issues are emphasised in this report as one of the primary themes affecting
                        the economic outlook of Orlando East.</p>

                    <p>Another major gap identifed was also the community’s access to–and willingess to
                        use–‘information.’ Examples of <em>information</em> in this case included employment
                        opportunities, rules and regulations, or government plans. A related problem–the lack of
                        community ‘spirit’ and volunteerism–was seen as not helpful in the local business environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although employment options seem to be available (primarily in small business and manual labour),
                        various factors mitigate against the takeup of these opportunities. These include lack of
                        relevant skills, education, and the availability of finance or credit. A lack of awareness
                        regarding financial management, banking and debt was a related issue, as was the perceived
                        increase in ‘competition’ from foreign migrants starting up small businesses in the area.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the political history of Soweto (South Western Township) cannot be overstated as having
                        influenced the current economic conditions in Orlando East, including the status of Soweto as
                        essentially a dormitory suburb with restrictions on economic activity until at least 1977.
                        Coupled with a high population (currently believed to be more than 2 million) and the
                        ‘informality’ and ‘high mortality rates’ of local businesses, it is perhaps not surprising that
                        community respondents felt there was a considerable way to go towards improving the broader
                        economic outlook in Orlando East.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#orlando-world-vision-urban-pilot-project">World Vision urban pilot project</a></h3>

                    <p>Among those who know about World Vision and/or have an active partnership with the Orlando East
                        project, World Vision is held in high regard as a reliable, consultative partner. The project’s
                        efforts in connecting people to the job market and facilitating connections between
                        organisations have been well appreciated by interview respondents. Both the activities and
                        physical presence of World Vision in the area were considered visible by respondents.</p>

                    <p>The project has clearly been effective in communicating the changed focus of World Vision in
                        Orlando East to ‘economic development’. The World Vision ADP previously active in the area
                        included more direct community support activities, such as the distribution of food parcels, and
                        so we note that it would have been no small challenge to make a transition to a short term
                        project based on facilitation, sharing information and various forms of advocacy.</p>

                    <p>The legacy of a long-term engagement with World Vision has undoubtedly contributed to the high
                        levels of trust shared with the community. However, we note that such is the importance of World
                        Vision in the community that most of the existing partnerships are reliant upon World Vision as
                        a facilitator, and indeed these could not be sustained without its involvement. We were not able
                        to discern from the interview data just who else could be a similarly trusted, neutral and
                        connected community leader in World Vision’s place.</p>

                    <p>A network-mapping exercise conducted with the local Community Development Committee in 2009
                        showed government at the centre of the diagram. The role of World Vision appears to have evolved
                        into an important intermediary and facilitator between community and government. Our analysis
                        suggests that this position reflects an ‘interim’ stage of project maturity, where World Vision
                        is now central to the partner network, and the capacity of partners to sustain their activities
                        needs to be built. This highlights what could be a similar challenge for other ‘pilots’ and
                        similar ‘entry projects’ that have limited timeframes and exit strategies at the outset.</p>

                    <p>Although the Indicator Tracking Table shows under-achieved quantitative targets for the project
                        (e.g. number of youth trained to take up entrepreneurial and job opportunities<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn4">4</a></sup>), it is noted in this review that the project design
                        does not accurately reflect the substantial time involved in basic coordination of activities
                        across a range of organisations and industries. Given time and resource constraints on the
                        project team, it is possible that a more focused approach–working with fewer partners and less
                        prescriptive outputs in each case–would accomplish more. This would entail a much less
                        ambitiously scoped project design and in the process may help reduce the burden of M&amp;E and
                        budgeting described by staff. Alternatively, this may constitute evidence that the project is
                        ready to be scaled up, with more staff put in place to coordinate the many partner relationships
                        more intensively.</p>

                    <p>Working with and through partners wherever possible as a project approach was emphasised
                        repeatedly by staff during the review, and multiple references to this can be found in project
                        documents. While this is clearly a dominant theme with regard to urban engagement, what is less
                        clear are the specifics of ‘partnering’ as an objective, an activity, a staff attribute or a
                        measurable indicator in Orlando East. In reality it constitutes all of these elements, and there
                        are multiple ways that partnering can be described and demonstrated.</p>

                    <p>The assertion of ‘development as partnership’, or partnering as the primary mode of operating in
                        urban contexts, needs to be investigated further both in this pilot project and in future
                        reviews. More detailed reflection and evidence on this theme would assist in articulating
                        the:</p>

                    <p>As described, one of the drivers of the meta analysis process is the need to apply pilot project
                        lessons to current thinking on urban programming and funding approaches in World Vision. The
                        Orlando East review highlights some key lessons on programming that should be compared with
                        future reviews.</p>

                    <p>One of the key findings was that the most practical way to effect transformation in Orlando East
                        is to invest in ‘soft’ infrastructure, including facilitation, partnering, networking and
                        advocacy as previously described. This imperative makes it difficult to describe project
                        activities or demonstrate evidence of progress in any tangible way: “Sorry we don’t have a
                        vegetable garden.” Project staff run meetings, participate in public gatherings, provide advice
                        to stakeholders, and make referrals to service providers. These daily activities are admittedly
                        difficult to measure, yet are in fact conducted with a high degree of sensitivity to stakeholder
                        interests, political undertones, and ethical considerations such as equity and inclusion. In
                        addition, relationships with community and partners need to be managed with maturity and
                        transparency in order to be effective.</p>

                    <p>These intangible qualities should inform World Vision’s role in contributing to developmental
                        outcomes and child well-being in urban contexts. Indeed, if it were possible to build enough
                        support and ownership of child well-being aspirations among local partners, the urban approach
                        of Orlando East would be ideal for establishing a longer-term sustainability and transition
                        plan. By this we mean that World Vision would <em>already</em> be playing an indirect
                        facilitation role, and the accountability for child well-being would already sit with
                        communities, partners, and government. This is in contrast to World Vision having to initially
                        play a direct role in bringing about these outcomes, with a need to transition this role over
                        time.</p>

                        and Design, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (DM&amp;E)</a></h3>

                    <p>Several important lessons for the development and management of urban projects emerged through
                        exploration of UMF themes during this review.</p>

                    <p>The review team began to surmise that the word ‘project’ was not an entirely accurate way to
                        describe the nature of the engagement in Orlando East. This is because conventional methods of
                        ‘project management’, such as results or outcome-based accountability approaches (logframes,
                        etc.) were only partially applicable, and tend to under-emphasise or, at worst, mask actual
                        activities and achievements on the ground. While the fiscal accountability elements of
                        logframes, for instance, were appreciated, the usefulness of these tools for demonstrating
                        progress, or even measuring relevant indicators, were thrown into question.</p>

                    <p>One example of the ‘misfit’ of conventional project management approaches in urban contexts is
                        the lack of meaningful qualitative data collected since the 2010 baseline study. The baseline
                        methodology included the collection of in-depth case studies on individuals within Orlando East,
                        as a way of representing a ‘snapshot’ of personal livelihood situations and outlooks. The
                        intention of this approach was to establish a pseudo-longitudinal study of these individuals,
                        such that:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The experiences of the following people will be tracked throughout the life of the project to
                            develop an understanding of the changes that will take place and the impacts of the
                            project<sup><a href="#orlando-fn5">5</a></sup></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>However, this approach does not appear in the M&amp;E plan for the original Orlando East project,
                        and therefore was not included within implementation plans or indicator tracking tables in
                        subsequent years.</p>

                    <p>While the project team tried in earnest to track down these individuals to include them in the
                        review cohort, in most cases they were unavailale or no longer living in the area. Had this
                        review been structured as a formal evaluation, it would have been difficult to use the baseline
                        case studies as anything but indicative ‘snapshots’ of life for certain individuals in Orlando
                        East. This highlights the limitations of standardised indicator tracking and reporting
                        mechanisms within ‘projects’ that need to be reconsidered in light of the different requirements
                        in urban settings.</p>

                    <p>The original project design suggests that:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It is also important to realize that M&amp;E is not necessarily based on the indicators but
                            also on the definitive features of an urban setting. Research and learning through regular
                            reflection sessions will also be performed.<sup><a href="#orlando-fn6">6</a></sup></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Despite this, interviews with staff revealed that learning and reflection opportunities–and
                        particularly the documentation of these lessons–were now missing from project implementation.
                        One possible explanation is the absence of a DM&amp;E support staff or team member who could
                        facilitate reflection activities. The current staff cohort of only 2 are unable to do this on
                        their own:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>When you are involved in the game, you cannot be the referee. You need someone to stop the
                            game and talk about the rules.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Finally, the review raised a number of issues related to financial management and finance
                        systems, particularly in obtaining approval for funding the sorts of activities that accompany
                        facilitation, partnering and advocaacy. Staff would likely operate more effectively with a more
                        flexible accounting regime, provided that funded activities could be reconciled to project
                        outcomes.</p>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-key-recommendations-for-orlando-east-project">Key recommendations for Orlando East
                project</a></h2>

            <p>A summary of recommendations made by the review team, in light of the findings and analysis, is provided
                below. We suggest some possible areas to be tabled with relevant World Vision South Africa staff, in
                order to inform future plans for the Orlando East project–particularly to address planning for
                sustainability and transition, or, alternatively, project ‘scale up’:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A more targeted and strategic approach to partnering. Some of the more established project partners,
                    such as the SMME Forum and PlanAct, are more directly involved in economic development activities,
                    and also have strong organisational capacities for facilitating this. Project outputs could be
                    simplified to focus on what can be achieved through stronger–and possibly financial–partnerships
                    with these kinds of organisations.
                </li>
                <li>Related to the above, we suggest possibly separating general World Vision community assistance from
                    its economic development work. Current staff seemed adept at separating these activities (and as we
                    note, in practice they are closely related in this context). However they do not seem to be formally
                    acknowledged, and complicate the project design.
                </li>
                <li>As we note, economic development is a highly complex field, and even more so given the other
                    challenges in this environment. We recommend that operational staff be supplemented by research
                    capacity in the areas of business, finance and economics – possibly through internships from the
                    University of Johannesburg. This could assist in identifying particular opportunities for business
                    and employment in the area.
                </li>
                <li>The aim of creating a self-sustaining partner network in the area is, in our view, currently
                    unrealistic. We suggest this either means extending the life of the pilot considerably, or examining
                    mechanisms, such as a consultancy or small non-government organisation, to take up the work
                    currently undertaken by World Vision. The latter option is unlikely to be productive without at
                    least some kind of ongoing support from World Vision itself.
                </li>
                <li>The link between economic development and child wellbeing is difficult to realise, and to measure,
                    in any kind of 3-5 year project timeframe. This poses the question of whether a longer term plan
                    needs to be defined, at least schematically. Such a plan could include transitional arrangements,
                    where specific World Vision-funded development projects could ‘spin-off’ to other entities. A
                    current difficulty is understanding who those entities might be in this area.
                </li>
                <li>Staff expressed concerns about the time and complexity of current processes for reporting and
                    budgeting. Given the nature of the work on this project, these concerns appeared well founded. We
                    recommend finding ways to allow for more flexible allocation of funds to support ‘soft’ development
                    work involved in partnering, facilitation and advocacy (covering various areas such as venue hire,
                    catering, transportation, communication, printing and so on).
                </li>
                <li>Associated with the previous recommendation, it may be that current project management tools need to
                    be modified to fit the purpose and mode of engagement in the community. Moving forward, a key
                    contribution of this pilot could be the trialing of differential approaches to M&amp;E/financial
                    management that reflect the elements of facilitation, negotiation, relationship-building, and other
                    associated activities.

                reviews/pilot evaluations</a></h2>

            <p>We make the following recommendations for the methodological aspects of future reviews:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue with iterations of the current community, partner and staff instruments (including the
                    Partner Assessment Tool).
                </li>
                <li>Incorporate formal instructions for interviewers, plain language statements and consent forms.</li>
                <li>Continue with the practice of ‘role-playing’ interviews on the first day of the review.</li>
                <li>Record interviews wherever possible.</li>
                <li>Separate ‘quant’ from ‘qual’ survey instruments, and conduct the quantitative surveys separately,
                    with larger cohorts.
                </li>
                <li>After initial analysis of the review or evaluation data, administer supplementary surveys with
                    proejct staff or select partners to elicit further information. This could particularly useful for
                    emergent themes that are unexpected, or for unanswered questions/extra detail that may be required
                    to complete the analysis.
                </li>
                <li>Terms like “community”, “government”, “partnership” and “project” should be anchored at the outset
                    of the interview (as well as clarified as much as possible at the start of the review process). In
                    practice we often clarified these terms, but not always in consistent ways. A recommendation would
                    be to have: A specific set of questions that asks the respondents to name their “community”, their
                    interaction with “government”, the nature of their “partnership” with World Vision, and their
                    knowledge of and interaction with the “project”.
                </li>
                <li>Include additional methods where appropriate, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Network mapping</li>
                        <li>Semi-structured observation (using “Walk&amp;Talk” or similar approaches)</li>
                        <li>Analysis of secondary materials, including published literature, statistical sources and
                            urban cultural forms
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Continue to examine methods for measuring impact and effectiveness of partnering, facilitation and
                    advocacy. One specific recommendation here is to develop an indicator of partner network
                    ‘maturity’–the extent to which a set of partnerships could survive without one or more participants.

    <p>The Orlando East review described in this report was conducted in the last week of November, 2012. Two World
        Vision Australia staff, John van Kooy and David Lansley, were accompanied to Johannesburg by Liam Magee, an
        academic from RMIT University acting as a consultant. We spent a total of 5 days in Orlando East. On the Monday
        we met the World Vision staff at head office, followed by introductions to the Orlando East project team and
        students from the nearby University of Johannesburg. We also rehearsed and refined the interview scripts with
        the students. Tuesday to Thursday we conducted interviews with a range of community members and partners, mostly
        in the Orlando East area. On Friday we conducted 4 staff interviews in the morning, and spent the afternoon
        writing up remaining notes from the interviews.</p>

    <p>The Orlando East review is the first of six planned reviews of urban pilot projects by World Vision’s Centre of
        Expertise for Urban Programming. As such, it also pilots an approach to evaluating project progress in urban
        contexts. For reasons we outline in this report, the urban locus of these projects provides both challenges and
        opportunities for evaluation. This review dwells at some length on these. In addition to the discussion of the
        Orlando East project itself, we reflect here upon broader theoretical and methodological questions concerning
        evaluation in the urban context.</p>

    <div class="section level2" id="orlando-the-orlando-east-project">
        <div class="section level2">
            <h2><a href="#orlando-the-orlando-east-project">The Orlando East Project</a></h2>

            <p>The Orlando East Project is well described in the Baseline Project <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2010a)</span>:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The Orlando East Urban Pilot Project is one of the projects of the Urban Programs Initiative (UPI)
                    which was set up by World Vision Australia to research and develop programming approaches suited for
                    the urban context.</p>

                <p>Situated in Soweto, Johannesburg, the Orlando East urban pilot project was initiated by the UPI
                    during the redesign phase of the Orlando East ADP. The ADP had been operating for ten years and was
                    based on a direct benefits model of programming.</p>

                <p>The Orlando East Urban Pilot project began in 2008 with a particular focus in developing a Local
                    Economic Development approach suitable for addressing issues of livelihoods in the urban context and
                    helping to transition the existing ADP towards more sustainable forms of development programming.
                    The Assessment and Design phase included the piloting of the Participatory Appraisal for Competitive
                    Advantage (PACA) tool which resulted in a number of priority areas identified and task teams
                    generated to promote local economic development within Orlando East. The task teams were formed
                    around the following areas: Environment, Small and Medium Enterprises, Skills Development, Tourism,
                    and Informal Traders.</p>

                <p>Through developing the capacity of the task teams and strengthening existing local governance
                    mechanisms, the project aims to contribute towards improved economic conditions in Orlando East and
                    ultimately enhancing the quality of life for children in Orlando East.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Since the Baseline Report, there have been several minor changes of focus. As the 2012 Project Design
                outlines <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2012)</span>, there has been a greater
                emphasis more recently on <em>partnering</em> (with other community and business organisations), <em>advocacy</em>
                (to government) and <em>facilitation</em> (between community, business and government groups).
                Accordingly, there has been less focus on World Vision itself driving economic development activities
                (through training, workshops and other initiatives).</p>

            <p>Another change is the welcome recognition of the interplay between economic development and child
                wellbeing, on the one hand, and a host of what have been termed ‘cross cutting themes’, on the other.
                Such themes include health (specifically HIV/AIDS), drugs and crime, government accountability, child
                abuse and inadequate skills and information. Our findings confirm these are major obstacles to both
                economic development and child wellbeing.</p>

            <p>In relation to the first objective, we note that this review should further the aims of the previous <em>Baseline
                Report</em> and <em>Project Design</em> documents. From the <em>Baseline Report</em>, research
                objectives included:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>

                the constrained time of the review data collection period limits our ability to respond to these
                objectives, for consistency we schematically compare findings with the <em>Baseline Report</em> in our

            <p>Soweto, an acronym for South Western Township, is a predominantly black urban area within the
                municipality of Johannesburg in Gauteng Province. It lies 23 km south of Johannesburg, and covers an
                area of 106 sq km. Soweto arose out of a cluster of townships created to house black miners and other
                workers. The 1923 Native (Urban Areas) Act allowed the forced relocation of black people, and by 1936,
                12,000 people had been relocated to Orlando East, an early Soweto township. Forced removals to Soweto
                accelerated after the start of apartheid in 1948<sup><a href="#orlando-fn9">9</a></sup>, and migration
                to Soweto has continued in the post-apartheid era. Soweto is now the largest black urban area in South
                Africa.</p>

            <p>Soweto’s population has risen substantially over the past decade. The 2001 census counted 858,644 people;
                by 2008 the population was estimated to be 1.3 million and is currently believed to be more than 2
                million<sup><a href="#orlando-fn10">10</a></sup>. Growth in Soweto’s population is consistent with
                trends in Gauteng Province as a whole. Between 2001 and 2011, Gauteng’s share of South Africa’s
                population rose from 21.04% to 22.39%, and the province attracted a net inflow of 367,076 people over
                the five years to 2011. Only one other province, Western Cape, had a significant inflow of people over
                that period (95,556)<sup><a href="#orlando-fn11">11</a></sup>. At the 2001 census, population density
                was around 8,100 people per square km, and is almost certainly higher now given the growth of
                prefabricated housing in the yards of existing dwellings.</p>

            <p>On these numbers, Soweto’s population density is relatively high when compared with other UPI pilot
                project sites, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surabaya (2012) - 8,300/km2</li>
                <li>La Paz (2008) - 1,861.2/km2</li>
                <li>Kanpur (2011) - 1,366/km2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, with the majority of housing being single and two-storied dwellings, it is still not especially
                high by global city standards.</p>

                    <p>Soweto is frequently referred to as a low income area, although the spread of income (or perhaps

                    <p>Data in Figure 1<sup><a href="#orlando-fn12">12</a></sup> confirms the north region (which
                        includes Orlando East) is one of the poorer parts of Soweto. The proportion of households in the
                        three lowest income categories was 43.6% in the north, similar to the east’s 44.0%, and well
                        above the south’s 34.7%. The north and east both had the highest proportion of households with
                        ‘limited and erratic income’ (25.2%), again well above the south’s 15.9%. Per capita income per
                        annum in 2004 however, was lowest in the central area of Soweto. At R9,381 it was nearly 7%
                        below the north’s level of R10,068, nearly 14% below the east’s R10,875, and more than 32% below

                    <h3><a href="#orlando-housing">Housing</a></h3>

                    <p>Soweto suffers from a chronic shortage of housing. The movement of people to Soweto –- both
                        forced, and more recently, to take advantage of employment opportunities in the Johannesburg
                        area–has meant that housing has been in short supply for many years<sup><a href="#orlando-fn13">13</a></sup>.
                        Original four room ‘matchbox’ houses dating back to before the Second World War remain an
                        important source of housing in the older parts of Soweto, including Orlando, though many have
                        been since improved and extended. There are also significant areas of informal settlement<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn14">14</a></sup>. The introduction of a 99 year leasehold system in
                        1978 encouraged private home ownership among wealthier Soweto residents, and fostered privately
                        developed housing estates and infill housing, including in Orlando West and the various Proteas.
                        A collapse in the property market in the early 1990s saw banks largely withdraw from home
                        lending. In the post- apartheid era the government has played a larger role in the provision of
                        housing, but supply has failed to keep up with demand, and a significant backlog remains<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn15">15</a></sup>. Basic infrastructure, including paved roads,
                        water<sup><a href="#orlando-fn16">16</a></sup> and sewerage is also limited in parts of Soweto.
                    </p>

                    <p>The 2004 Soweto Market Research Survey collected data on the Soweto housing stock by broad area.
                        Orlando East is in the north region. The data in Figure 2<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn17">17</a></sup> below show that</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Home ownership–outright and mortgage–is 47%. For comparison homeownership in Spain, Italy
                            and Belgium is 78%, Brazil (another BRICS economy) 74%, Britain and Australia 69%, the US
                            67%, and Germany 42%<sup><a href="#orlando-fn18">18</a></sup>. The relatively low level of
                            home ownership in Soweto is probably at least partly due to restrictions on property
                            ownership by black people for many years, plus low incomes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Brick houses are the most common type of dwellings in Soweto, accounting for 58% of the
                            total.
                        </li>
                        <li>Informal dwellings - house/flat in backyard, informal unit in backyard, informal unit not in

                    <p><!--| John's suggestion
                    * The north region is not greatly different from Soweto as a whole--home ownership 49%, brick houses 61%, informal dwellings 31% - although Orlando East, as a particularly low income area, may differ somewhat.

                    <h3><a href="#orlando-economy">Economy</a></h3>

                    <p>The economy of Soweto has been shaped considerably by its history. The 1923 Native (Urban Areas)
                        Act, as well as legalising forced relocation, imposed restrictions on the employment of African
                        people unless approved by the local authority. Subsequent legislation, including the 1957
                        Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act limited employment in Soweto to seven categories -
                        operating general shops, butcheries, eating houses, selling milk or vegetables, or hawking
                        goods. These restrictions encouraged development of a substantial informal economy. While
                        restrictions on economic activity were eased in 1977, giving rise to a local taxi industry,
                        informal trading is still an important economic activity for some people in Soweto<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn19">19</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>The economy of Soweto is also influenced by its proximity to Johannesburg. Johannesburg is the
                        biggest city in South Africa and the main financial centre of Africa. It is the base for South
                        Africa’s five TV stations, and is claimed to have the best telecommunications and technology on
                        the African continent. There is also a range of manufacturing in and around Johannesburg
                        including basic iron and steel, fabricated and metal products, food, machinery, electrical
                        machinery, appliances and electrical supplies, vehicle parts and accessories, chemical products,
                        food processing and beverages<sup><a href="#orlando-fn20">20</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Despite its physical size and proximity to Johannesburg, the City of Johannesburg has estimated
                        that, based on 2001 census and other data, Soweto’s formal economy made only a small
                        contribution to the overall Johannesburg metropolitan economy<sup><a href="#orlando-fn21">21</a></sup>.
                        As Figure 3<sup><a href="#orlando-fn22">22</a></sup> shows, while Soweto accounted for more than
                        40% of the region’s population, its unemployment rate was much higher than the rest of the
                        region and its economic contribution was less than 5% of total gross value added (GVA).
                        Moreover, Soweto’s economic contribution was heavily skewed towards the largely government
                        funded community services sector (including clinics, schools and hospitals). The contribution of
                        other areas of economic activity such as construction, transport and wholesale and retail trade
                        was each in the range 3-4%<sup><a href="#orlando-fn23">23</a></sup>.</p>

                  Further, Soweto’s limited economic impact is felt more in other parts of the
                  greater Johannesburg area than in Soweto itself. Despite the appearance of large
                  shopping malls in Soweto in recent years, it has been suggested that they have
                  moved at some spending outside Soweto by pushing out cheaper sources of goods,
                  forcing people to travel to Johannesburg^[Source: [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/07/201271810320982507.html](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/07/201271810320982507.html)]. More broadly, on one estimate only
                  about 24% of expenditure Soweto residents in occurs in the township^[Source: [http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4775:entrepreneurship-conference-in-soweto&catid=111&Itemid=194](http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4775:entrepreneurship-conference-in-soweto&catid=111&Itemid=194)].
                  
                  Agriculture in Gauteng province is aimed mainly at supplying fresh produce to
                  urban areas. Ground nuts (peanuts), sunflowers, cotton and sorghum are also
                  grown and there are a range of niche agricultural industries including essential
                  oils, organic foods, medicinal plants, and floriculture^[Source: [http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/gauteng.htm](http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/gauteng.htm)].

                    <p>Within Soweto, small and micro businesses are the main type of private economic activity. A study
                        by the Bureau of Market Research at the University of South Africa of small informal businesses
                        in Soweto over the period 2007-2011 found ‘relatively high mortality rates’<sup><a
                                href="#orlando-fn24">24</a></sup>. Just under 40% of businesses were still operating at
                        the end of the period, and survival rates were particularly low for street vendors and
                        home-based businesses. Further, fewer businesses were started than failed, implying a net
                        decline of almost 50% in the number of small businesses in the study area. Failing to respond to
                        an increasingly competitive environment was seen as a major reason for business failure.
                        Entrepreneurs who adapted to greater competitiveness, for example by changing or limiting their
                        product range or reducing employment, were more likely to survive. Larger and incorporated
                        businesses, those operating from permanent premises, those in older established business
                        centres, and franchises were found to have better prospects for survival.</p>

            <p>Interviewees were identified as belonging to a <em>Community</em>, <em>Partner</em> or <em>World Vision
                Staff</em> group, and asked questions from different interview scripts accordingly. Additionally,
                questions were grouped into three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Introductory Questions - identify and introduce the interviewee, as well as the organisation or
                    department they represent (where relevant).</p></li>
                <li><p>Framework Questions - derived from the Urban Meta-review Framework (UMF), these questions
                    explored themes that relate to urban development generally.</p></li>
                <li><p>Issue-based Questions - relate to the specific issue addressed by this pilot project. In this
                    case, the project issue was Economic Development.</p></li>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-analysis-of-results">Analysis of Results</a></h2>

            <p>The survey instruments include a range of both 10-point scales and longer verbal questions. We used
                simple descriptive statistics to describe scale item responses and thematic coding to group qualitative
                responses. The coding was conducted in <em>Dedoose</em>, an online qualitative data analysis tool. Codes
                were constructed in a “bottom-up” fashion, to reflect prevalent and emergent themes from responses.
                Although applied in an organic fashion, some effort was made to standardise and rationalise the codes
                across all documents. In the case of the most relevant themes, such as partnering and economic
                development, a large number of second-level or sub-codes were added to discriminate responses to these
                issues. Within Dedoose, notes were also differentiated in terms of the groups (Community, Partner,
                Staff) they belonged to.</p>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

            <p>The review suffered from a number of limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Being the first review, the generic framework of questions and indicators (referred to as the
                    <em>Urban Meta-analysis Framework</em> or <em>UMF</em>) were largely untested. Much of our analysis
                    has therefore focussed on the framework itself, in addition to the specific Orlando East project. An
                    associated limitation is that the indicators, questions and grouping themes were subject to
                    considerable change leading upto and even during the review.</p></li>
                <li><p>Interview subjects were hand-picked by World Vision staff, creating potential for biased sampling
                    and results.</p></li>
                <li><p>Small sample size and inconsistent application of questions severely curtail validity of
                    quantitative findings.</p></li>
                <li><p>The “bottom-up” approach to coding allows for considerable subjectivity in both the selection and
                    application of codes.</p></li>
                <li><p>The scope of the surveys is very broad: from specific and local questions about the project,
                    through to general and macro-level questions about urban programming and economic development. While
                    this was handled ‘on-the-fly’ by calibrating questions to suit particular respondents and contexts,
                    this breadth is an issue for consistency and reliability of responses.</p></li>
                <li><p>Respondents varied greatly in terms of English competency. In a number of cases we were therefore
                    reliant upon student assistants from the local university to translate questions and responses. This
                    limited both the accuracy and volume of responses recorded.</p></li>
                <li><p>In addition to the interviewer at least one note-taker was present at all interviews. However
                    accuracy varied due to a number of practical reasons (translation, sensitivity to context, extent of
                    notes), and this is reflected in the final interview notes.</p></li>
                <li><p>While the 2010 <em>Baseline</em> methodology included an in-depth case study approach targeting a
                    range of local residents in Orlando, when designing the methodology for the <em>Review</em> it was
                    found that most of the original interviewees were in available or had moved on from the area. In
                    addition, information about these local residents had not been maintained over time and thus there
                    was little scope for comparability between their changing situation between <em>Baseline</em> and
                    <em>Review</em>.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many of these limitations are offset by the ‘pilot’ nature of the review exercise itself. However they
                are pertinent both to further pilot reviews, and more generally, to evaluations of projects in urban
                contexts. We return to some of these issues in the <em>Conclusions and Recommendations</em> section.</p>

    <p>In the week of November 23–27, the research team of John van Kooy, David Lansley, Liam Magee and Liveson Manguwo,
        assisted by 5 enumerators and World Vision staff, conducted 24 interviews with individuals, organisations and
        staff involved in the Orlando East pilot project. Table 1 shows totals for each interview group.</p>

    <p>On the 23rd (Monday), the research team met National Office and project World Vision staff, as well as the
        enumerators. The afternoon and evening were spent refining the three surveys, culling excess questions and
        refining those that remained. For the rest of the week (24-27), interviews were conducted approximately inline
        with the above groupings, e.g. most community members were interviewed on the Tuesday and Wednesday (24th,
        25th), most partners were interviewed on Wednesday and Thursday, while World Vision staff were interviewed on
        Friday. The research team re-developed the staff survey extensively on the Friday morning, to allow for greater
        depth than the original questions would have allowed for.</p>

            <p>Some of the respondents represented community organisations that were in partnership with World Vision.

            <p>We interviewed 5 World Vision staff members, all of whom had been involved with the Orlando East project

            <p>In general, staff interviews were only partially structured around the Staff Survey guide, and many of
                the pre-developed questions were not asked directly. This was considered by the evaluation team to be an
                acceptable approach as many of the UMF themes were addressed in the generalised responses of staff. In
                particular, issues of mobility, diversity, vulnerability, and significant detail on partnerships emerged
                from these interviews.</p>

            <p>Community responses were somewhat split on question 24a, ‘Please indicate whether, over the past year,
                you believe your community’s situation has been improving, staying the same, or getting worse’. Two
                respondents thought the situation had been improving. One suggested the reason for this was that people
                in the community were ‘learning more things, skills’. Another directly referenced the work of World
                Vision in agricultural training, stating that ‘People are improving because of this training. They try
                to stand for themselves’. Two respondents thought things were getting worse, with one suggesting that
                the ‘situation was getting worse’ due to a wide range of factors: use of drugs and alcohol, crime rates,
                poverty and unemployment, HIV/AIDS causing parents to go into prostitution. They concluded their
                response with a general assessment of desparation, saying the community was characterised by
                ‘lawlessness’ and that children ‘no longer have respect for elders’. Four other respondents thought the
                situation remained the same, with one respondent also suggesting that factors of drug use, poverty and
                crime remained endemic.</p>

            <p>Reponses to question 25a, ‘Please identify the main causes of community vulnerability’, generally
                referenced similar factors: unemployment, poverty, HIV/AIDS, drugs and crime. One respondent also
                referenced problems of ‘crowded and poor quality housing, and the influx of people to Orlando’. The
                issue of age demography arose in two other responses: one stated that it was ‘particularly difficult for
                young people’, while another mentioned that children were frequently left with elderly carers due to the
                impact of AIDS. Education, skills and access to information were mentioned by several respondents as
                strategies for mitigating vulnerability.</p>

            <p>Question 26, ‘In your community, is there a big difference between the richest and poorest members?’,
                sought to explore perceptions of financial inequality in the community. All but two reponses were in
                agreement with the implied proposition. Some suggested that as people grew wealthier they tended to move
                away, while one respondent said that more recently there has been a trend for the growing middle class
                in the region to stay and renovate their homes. Although inequality is a noted feature of both Sowetan
                and South African society generally, as a note for future surveys, this particular question needs to be
                more neutrally worded in future surveys, to reduce its inherent bias and improve validity.</p>

            <p>Question 27, ‘Do you think these issues influence how much people move (e.g. from rural areas to the
                city)?’, suggested that economic opportunity is the main movitation for mobility. One respondent stated
                that ‘poor people are moving to find jobs in other cities; when the “place is dry” they will go to
                another place’. Another mentioned that rural migration was happening because of ‘better opportunities’,
                though this was leading to increased racism in Noordgesig (a neighbouring district of Orlando East): the
                area ‘used to be a coloured area, now there are different races and its hard for them to accept’.</p>

            <p>Questions 29, ‘Do you believe the World Vision project has had a significant impact on the poor in your
                community?’, elicited a range of reponses. Some respondents referenced specific impacts: ‘tools [for]
                food gardening’; ‘food parcels’; bursaries and awards to students; and more general assistance to the
                vulnerable. Two other respondents thought, however, the specific economic aims of the project were not
                well-known in the community. Only one respondent referenced specific activities, stating:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The more we make meetings with them the more we grow. Also in terms of networking with other youth

                general respondents were critical of both government and community sectors, and positive in relation to

                        both questions and responses tended to conflate local, provincial and national government
                        levels. This conflation could itself be viewed as an indicator, however, of poor levels of
                        engagement with the Orlando East community. Respondents felt government had specifically ignored
                        the plight of the poor. In the words of one respondent:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>This government of ours – they are looking for riches. They are not looking out for the

                    <p>Another respondent stated that ‘other people are closer with the government but not those that
                        are at the bottom’.</p>

                    <p>Yet another demanded that the government:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Stop looking after rich people. For example, the President meets with businesses in Joburg,
                            but not with poor people in Soweto.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Respondents also felt overwhelmingly that the government had failed to communicate
                        effectively:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Hard for community to reach the government… Many people in the Ward forums have been
                            complaining about that.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Another respondent linked this to a more general issue of accountability:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Government does not give feedback if they are delayed in delivering specific services. The
                            government do not report back or do follow ups.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Even when public meetings are held, outcomes are less than optimal:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Attendance is by chance. When notices are distributed they are met with negative comments,
                            which affects attendance.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>And:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Information is available but access is not. Pamphlets handed out the day before meetings.
                            Informed community too late. Invite them with time.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>These two issues of inequity and communication were linked to the issues of corruption and
                        nepotism. One respondent stated that ‘people who engage are those involved with political
                        parties’, while another explicitly mentioned the issue of ‘nepotism – ANC members benefit each
                        other’s families’. A third respondent felt that the local government did provide jobs for the
                        community, but this was frequently linked to the ‘ongoing problem of bribery’.</p>

                    <p>Some responses indicated ways the government could do more to assist the community. One suggested
                        that ‘there must be more programs about government issues on Soweto TV’, while another
                        recommended that the goverment ‘must create parks’, as these can ‘make a difference’.</p>

                    <p>Against the generally critical trend, one respondent did feel the govenment had played a positive
                        role, stating that ‘the community’s ability to engage with government was good’ and the
                        government had ‘made itself accountable for failure to deliver on promises’.</p>

                    <p>Questions 59a, 60a and 61a asked respondents to provide further details on related closed
                        questions that seek to measure attitudes towards aspects of the local community. These aspects
                        include, for the respective question, the community’s ability to work together, its awareness of
                        its rights as citizens, and its access to information. As a preliminary note, in hindsight the
                        order of these questions should be reversed, to reflect the logic of decision-making and agency:
                        how well the community is informed (61a); how well it is able to transform information into
                        decisions (60a); and how well those decisions can be acted upon collectively (59a). Accordingly,
                        responses are presented in this reverse order.</p>

                            <p>The five respondents to this question were divided about the levels of information in the
                                community. Three thought there was sufficient information available on community
                                matters, but that people did not utilise it effectively, due to ‘ignorance’ and lack of
                                motivation. In the words of one respondent:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>There is a multi purpose community centre (MPCC) that is responsible for providing
                                    information to people. Library provides a lot of information, but people do not go
                                    seeking information. They are ignorant.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>The other two respondents felt that while there was sufficient information, not all
                                community members had adequate access to it. One complained that:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Pamphlets handed out the day before meetings. Informed community too late. Invite
                                    them with time.’</p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </div>
                        <div class="section level6" id="orlando-rights">

                            <h6><a href="#orlando-rights">Rights</a></h6>

                            <p>This translated into similar ambivalence about the community’s awareness of its rights.
                                One respondent felt that ‘people know their rights but not their obligations’; another
                                agreed, but suggested that they “don’t know how they can practice their rights”. Others
                                felt again there was a general problem of ‘ignorance’, both about rights and ways to
                                express them. Respondents were divided about whether this related to the prior problem
                                of information, or to a lack of general enterprise and hope in the community. In the
                                words of one respondent:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>People are ignorant and reluctant to take advantage of whats being offered. They feel
                                    government is not doing anything good. People are resistant, don’t want to find out
                                    information because of ANC.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>A number of respondents suggested potential remedies: more timely notification of public
                                meetings; more widespead use of community boards and pamplets; and growing use of the
                                Internet and social media.</p>

                            <p>As a side note, while this question was worth asking, the review team felt that a prior
                                question needed to be asked concerning respondents’ perceptions of rights, so that the
                                question concerning awareness would relate to reasonable and context-appropriate
                                “rights”.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="section level6" id="orlando-community-action">
                        </div>

                            <p>There was similarly some variance in responses to the ability of the community to work
                                towards common goals. Some felt there was reasonable co-operation, but that this was
                                compromised by lack of information and empowerment. A specific issue raised by one
                                respondent was that a number of people lacked adequate identification and could not
                                therefore vote (clearly an issue related both to information and expression of rights).
                                Another respondent (a small trader from Mozambique) expressed a stark lack of community
                                co-operation:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>People aren’t working together and they are looking out for themselves… Money and
                                    stereotyping are the main challenges that they are facing in the community.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>A further issue concerned low rates of volunteerism, which for one respondent also
                                limited employment options:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>People do not want to volunteer. They want jobs and so sometimes they don’t
                                    volunteer… They don’t understand that volunteering can lead to getting a job – still
                                    trying to find a way.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>These particular difficulties had an obvious negative impact given the importance of
                                community co-ordination: ‘[we have] high rates of crime so we need to involve
                                communities in these issues’.</p>

                    <p>Verbal responses to question 62a, about community participation in the World Vision project,
                        reflected the high scores the associated quantitative question (62) received. This assessment is
                        slightly skewed by the fact that interviewers only asked this pair of question if they felt the
                        respondents themselves were aware of the project and World Vision’s role in it.</p>

                    <p>All respondents felt that involvement was either improving or already high.Improvements to
                        involvement in the project included additional advertisements and further promotion through
                        community forums and events. One respondent mentioned the need to address a perception that
                        World Vision and its partners earned money through the project: ‘people think we earn money so
                        people have different mentalities’. However, among respondents there was a sense that World
                        Vision is a strongly trusted partner in the community:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>World Vision is there for everybody; look after the people; making trainings etc.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This was clearly enhanced by the physical presence of World Vision in the area; two respondents
                        referred to the visibility of the World Vision office and staff.</p>

<p>We also asked twenty-two additional open-ended questions, relating specifically to economic development. These were
    largely directed towards community members (as well as one of the partners, the SMME Forum). These were broadly
    categories under two headings:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Perceived current situation and options</li>
    <li>Perceptions of / preferred options for future improvement</li>

    <h4><a href="#orlando-current-situation-and-options">Current Situation and Options</a></h4>

    <p>We asked a total of 8 questions concerning the current economic situation and options in Orlando East. Due to
        overlapping content and time constraints, not all questions were asked of all respondents – we obtained between
        3 (question 8a) and 12 responses.</p>

    <div class="section level5" id="orlando-current-options">
        <div class="section level5">
            <h5><a href="#orlando-current-options">Current options</a></h5>

            <p>In response to question ED1, ‘What are the currently available options for jobs or earning income?’,
                responses outlined a range of perceived options, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recycling</li>
                <li>Installing and maintaining energy and water facilities</li>
                <li>Bakeries</li>
                <li>Sports coaching</li>
                <li>Recycling &amp; buy-back centres</li>
                <li>Handiworks</li>
                <li>Car washes</li>
                <li>Selling fast food (‘bunny chows’)</li>
                <li>Performing and teaching music</li>
                <li>PC sales and maintenance</li>
                <li>Hospitality: restaurants, B&amp;B’s and kiosks</li>
                <li>Construction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Curiously, respondents didn’t emphasise some of the options which they themselves were employed in, such
                as hairdressing or administration. This suggests that even current employment options were not
                necessarily synonymous with jobs held by respondents.</p>

            <p>Respondents also referred to characteristics they thought important for finding jobs or earning income.
                Similar to community responses above, factors such as skills, education and self-reliance or
                independence featured in multiple responses. Two small business owners also expressed doubt about the
                utility of available finance options for expanding their business. One respondent, a PC reseller,
                stated: “I believe I should save money for myself rather than taking loans because at the end it is
                difficult to repay them”.</p>

            <p>The SMME Forum, which largely represents skilled tradespeople, mentioned that they expected prospects in
                the construction industry to improve in 2013 due to government funding of 15 ‘superblocks’ in the area.
                This would increase the availability of sub-contracting work.</p>

            <p>In response to questions ED2 (‘How would you find out about employment and access better economic
                opportunities?’) and ED3 (‘What are the sources of information on employment, business opportunities,
                skills training etc.?’), responses identified a number of common sources of information. These
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Press reports</li>
                <li>Billboards</li>
                <li>Flyers and posters</li>
                <li>Radio</li>
                <li>Urban newspapers</li>
                <li>Government service providers</li>

                <li>World Vision</li>
                <li>Websites</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Again the SMME Forum provided considerable detail on the process of locating employment and business
                opportunity. Based on interview data, they believe 70-80% of people they interview ‘have the potential
                to run their own business’. The Forum understands its role to provide a level of practical skill and
                business management to would-be entrepreneurs. In their view, there is a very strong need for small
                businesses in the area to acquire business and financial management skills, and they welcomed World
                Vision’s support in running financial training sessions recently. Towards that end, they are currently
                developing a member database to match CVs and skills with available opportunities, and have also
                petitioned government to reduce the overhead to establish a business. Practically, they offer common
                sense advice to young people considering starting their own business. A key question they often ask
                is:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>What do they <em>really</em> want to do? What kind of business, and why?</p>

                      currently there are economic challenges?&#39;;</code></pre>
            <p>Question ED7 similarly asked:</p>
                  <pre><code>Do people perceive that they are in a better place now despite any shorter term economic
                      fluctuations that may have occurred?</code></pre>
            <p>while ED8a asked:</p>
                  <pre><code>Please explain why you believe there has been a permanent improvement (despite temporary
                      setbacks), your community since the project started?</code></pre>
            <p>Most respondents were cautiously optimistic concerning prospects for growth. 6 out of 7 respondents felt
                their business prospects were ‘viable’; two of these emphasised the need to be creative and flexible. As
                a PC reseller put it: ‘businesses always need to be open and flexible which is why his focus is now more
                on selling parts than rebuilding computers’. With regard to the broader scope of question ED7, responses
                were more measured. Two respondents thought things had improved generally, due to reduced crime rates
                and higher levels of individual registrations – essential for obtaining birth certificates and social
                grants. As the manager of Footprints put it, ‘How frustrated you would be if you don’t know who you
                are?’ Other respondents suggested things had <em>not</em> improved, stating factors like unemployment,
                cost of living and access to government services remained ‘sources of pressure’. Though only three
                responses were given to question ED8a, these also elicited split responses in relation to the project
                itself. One respondent did feel there had been an important transition during the project, from
                receiving ‘food parcels’ through to being more ‘hands on’, concluding with the remark: ‘There is
                empowerment’.</p>

            <p>Question ED5 asked:</p>
                  <pre><code>What have been the changes over time to your business or
                      employment? – is it now harder, more dangerous? Has it improved etc.? </code></pre>
            <p>In contrast with the previous responses, nearly all respondents to question ED5 (8 out of 9) were
                generally in agreement that the business operating environment had not improved or become more
                difficult. The main reasons for this were increased competition; lack of business management skills;
                changing technology environment; and ongoing security issues. Of these, competition – particularly from
                recent migrants to Soweto – seems by far the most significant. One respondent felt:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>People from other countries e.g. Pakistan, Somalia, are organised and displacing local residents.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another saw ‘foreign’ methods of business operation as something to learn from:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>need to ask foreigners how best to run their business rather than complaining.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Only one respondent mentioned security issues. This suggests perhaps, along with the responses to
                question ED7, crime has been diminishing as a threat to business operation, at least compared with other
                factors.</p>

            <p>Questions ED6 (‘Would you be happy to see your children working in this sector? And why?’) and ED8a
                (‘Please explain why you believe there has been a permanent improvement (despite temporary setbacks),
                your community since the project started?’) were only deemed worth asking a small number of respondents.
                2 out of 3 respondents to ED6 did not wish to see their children working in the same sector, though for
                mixed reasons (one mentioned lack of financial rewards; the other thought children should find their own
                careers).</p>

            <p>On the whole these responses indicate that improvement has been, as one respondent suggested, in ‘dribs
                and drabs’. While generally optimistic, community respondents felt there was a considerable way to go to
                improve the broader economic outlook in the area.</p>

            <p>Question ED9 asked ‘Do you feel things are looking better when you look into the future? Why/why not?’.
                Consistent with the general optimism expressed regarding prospects (ED4), respondents were confident
                that ‘things will pick up’. Various reasons were given for this confidence, at both national and local
                levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A fully fledged, multi-party democracy ‘gives hope’, and would encourage large-scale national
                    investment
                </li>
                <li>Volunteers at one of the co-operatives were developing skills and education, and were in a better
                    position to gain full-time education
                </li>
                <li>Improved management of HIV/AIDS meant those with the focus might be ‘more able to do something’ for
                    themselves

            <h5><a href="#orlando-economic-development-obstacles">Economic Development Obstacles</a></h5>

            <p>Questions ED10a and ED11 concerned <em>obstacles</em> to economic development. The two questions were
                closely related, and we have consolidated and summarised responses. Question ED10a asked ‘What are the
                obstacles to people realising economic goals?’, and ED11 asked ‘What are some of the obstacles to
                employment or business opportunities?’. We received a wide range of responses to both questions, ranging
                from general national concerns through to local specific difficulties. Three main categories of
                obstacles emerged from the responses to both questions: those relating to gaining employment or starting
                up businesses; those relating to the general business environment; and those relating to the government.
                The complete set of obstacles is listed below:</p>

            <p><strong>Employment or Business Start-up Obstacles</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of resources to upgrade buildings and equipment</li>
                <li>Lack of technical and business management skills</li>
                <li>Lack of information</li>
                <li>Lack of market preparedness and research</li>
                <li>Lack of work experience</li>
                <li>Unemployment</li>
                <li>Past criminal records</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Lack of education</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Business Environment Obstacles</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Costs</li>
                <li>Increased competition</li>
                <li>Unavailability of skilled labour</li>
                <li>Generating cash flow</li>
                <li>Changing customer preferences</li>
                <li>Company liquidations and bankruptcies</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Governmental Obstables</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulties of compliance with government schemes</li>
                <li>Government expenditure in the wrong areas</li>
                <li>Complexity of bureaucracy</li>
                <li>Poor communication</li>
                <li>Corruption</li>
                <li>High taxation</li>
                <li>Unequal provision of services</li>
                <li>High dependency on government funding for investment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These themes echo those of previous question group, and indeed the coding of responses below. Of
                particular interest here, compared with more developed economic environments, are the prominent
                complaints about government. Indeed the different factors (and the length respondents were prepared to
                go to detail them) indicate a common view that government is both not helping and actively hindering
                economic development – committing both sins of omission and commission. At the same time, the
                respondents view the government as a partner, facilitator and even investor in many economic development
                projects in Orlando East.</p>

            <p>This view is reinforced by the views of the SMME Forum, who offered a diplomatic but critical view of
                government activities. The following is an extented paraphrase of their response, capturing the
                diversity of difficulties faced by small contractors:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A lack of skills is a major obstacle facing small businesses. Some people with technical skills lack
                    business skills and some business people do not have adequate technical skills. Mobility is also a
                    problem, particularly in the building sector. Because the labour force is very mobile, there is a
                    constant need for training. The Forum is working with WV to better monitor the pool of available
                    skilled labour. There is the problem of the need for businesses to expand out of Soweto and even
                    beyond South Africa. This requires skills and finance. And competition has become more intense,
                    forcing businesses to become more creative, e.g. the development of a new greenfields township. (The
                    developer is trying to get the municipality on board, and provincial government support is needed
                    for schools and housing. Current problem is that finance is needed to purchase the land).</p>

                <p>The main obstacles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lack of information</li>
                    <li>Lack of preparedness - e.g. what is the gap in the market?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As an example we recently met 2 young people wanting to ‘sell ideas’. They had not done enough
                    research into the advertising industry, which already employed lots of creative people. We advised
                    them to re-think and change their business plan.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>At a small business level, these concerns were echoed by many respondents. A hairdresser discussed the
                difficulties of retaining customers:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>[It is] hard. Unemployed people love his salon; but if they are working, they prefer to go up-market.
                    To be more attractive, would love to improve structure of building. Renovate with brick
                    construction; get proper salon equipment.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another respondent focussed on the issue of corruption:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>People are unemployed; when community leaders are employed, they become rich for families, not for
                    the whole community; they sell some work, a form of bribery, only helping their friends to go up
                    (particularly in government)… bribery is “ripe”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The PC reseller complained of more conventional economic difficulties:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The main obstacles are taxation and prices that are too high for many people.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h5><a href="#orlando-removing-obstacles-and-creating-opportunities">Removing Obstacles and Creating
                Opportunities</a></h5>

            <p>Questions ED12a and ED13a were again closely related, examining ways obstacles could be removed and
                opportunities created. ED12a asked ‘Why do you believe your community is in a position to change or
                influence these obstacles?’ and ED13a asked ‘Why do you believe your community is in a position to
                create opportunities?’. Responses here were somewhat vague and hence difficult to summarise. In contrast
                to the preceding answers, a number of respondents replied that the community needed both attitudinal and
                behavioural change. For example, the manager of Footprints replied ‘People can only smile when they get
                up in the morning’. One respondent thought that the community needed ‘to give him a chance to show his
                work’, while another stated:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Motivation must be provided to people to encourage them and show appreciation of what they are
                    doing…. People don’t appreciate a good thing until something wrong happens.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The manager of the SMME forum suggested focussing on additional avenues to government for opportunities:
                ‘Businesses have social responsibility; people are not tapping into that’. A further limitation, in his
                view, was that while the potential existed to create new opportunities, ‘there was a tendency for
                discussions not to reach the implementation stage’. Nevertheless, there had been some positive
                developments and ‘success has encouraged people’.</p>

            <p>A common material requirement, particularly among those working in the informal and community development
                sector, was for better basic equipment for gardening, hairdressing and other small business
                opportunities. One respondent pointed to the ability of government to create opportunities through
                investment in ‘infrastructure, music festivals, new stadium’.</p>

        <div class="section level5">
            <h5><a href="#orlando-livelihoods-in-the-city">Livelihoods in the City</a></h5>

            <p>Question ED14 focussed on the relationship between economic development and the urban environment, asking
                ‘Could you describe ways in which being in a city makes it easier to earn your livelihood? How does the
                city make it harder to earn your livelihood?’. Responses were roughly split. Several respondents
                mentioned the greater availability of work:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>In Johannesburg, easier to get “petty money” compared with rural areas.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>You can make a living if you put your pride aside.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Urban opportunities are much better than opportunities in rural areas, although city by-laws are
                    restrictive and can make life difficult.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Two respondents mentioned downsides of the urban environment: high crime rates and the fact that it was a
                ‘dog eat dog’ world.</p>

        <div class="section level5">
            <h5><a href="#orlando-future-options">Future Options</a></h5>

            <p>Questions ED15 and ED16 focussed on future options for economic development. Both asked variants of ‘What
                do people see as their best options for economic development?’. Most responses focussed on small
                business opportunities, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Waste management</li>
                <li>Food produce and urban agriculture</li>
                <li>Bricklaying, painting, paving</li>
                <li>IT</li>
                <li>Tourism</li>
                <li>Working in their own businesses</li>
                <li>House renovations</li>
                <li>Car washing</li>
                <li>Health</li>
                <li>Sport (and associated industries)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The SMME Forum again provided a useful overview of potential areas of economic growth:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>People’s own businesses provide the best economic opportunities. Local businesses keep more people
                    and money in Soweto. Lack of local shopping complexes. Both grass roots expansion and expansion via
                    partnerships with bigger organisations (e.g. the Master Builders’ Federation) are needed. Bigger
                    organisations have the advantage of providing more training. It’s possible for large multinationals
                    and local home-grown businesses to work together. Established companies - mainly white - can help
                    local businesses get BEE compliance; improve scorecard ratings, improve skills transfer.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Question ED17 asked a follow-up question relating to the degree of control respondents felt they had over
                such options (‘In your view, do you think you are able to influence the economic options available to
                you? Or is the context too dynamic and changing too rapidly?’). This was asked of three respondents. One
                respondent was positive about the potential for small business ‘to undercut shops in the shopping
                malls’, and viewed advertising as particularly important to driving business growth. Another felt
                ‘adapting to change is difficult because the pace of change is so rapid’.</p>

        <div class="section level5">
            <h5><a href="#orlando-examining-the-bigger-picture">Examining the Bigger Picture</a></h5>

            <p>Questions ED18, ED19 and ED20 examined broader and longer term trends affecting economic options.
                Question ED18 asked “Do you see yourself as still working in this type of work in five years’ time? If
                not, why not?” Three out of four respondents weren’t certain; one replied that they “Don’t want to stay
                in the same work but would not give up on it”. One respondent, working at the community Environmental
                Forum, was optimistic that this was a growth area, since ‘our levels of understanding on environmental
                issues is increasing’.</p>

            <p>Question ED19 asked ‘What changes to this sector would you like to see?’. Two respondents reaffirmed the
                need for ‘modernised equipment’ and infrastructure, while a third mentioned he would like to see
                ‘changes in local regulations to make them less restrictive’.</p>

            <p>Question ED20 asked ‘Do you expect national or international economic trends to limit your ability to
                raise income in the future?’. Three out of four respondents weren’t sure or didn’t think foreign events
                had an undue impact on them in the foreseeable future, other than to increase prices. The manager of
                Footprints felt that foreign ‘investors’, including NGOs, were playing an important role in providing
                funds for ‘sports, education, health’.</p>

        <div class="section level5">
            <h5><a href="#orlando-orlando-east">Orlando East</a></h5>

            <p>Question ED21 examined the specific context of Orlando East, asking ‘What aspects of Orlando East do you
                feel attract people? What aspects of Orlando East either deters people from coming here or encourages
                them to leave?’. We received ten responses to this question. Two themes stood out: the vital role of
                Orlando East in the political history of South Africa, and the recently built Orlando Stadium, which
                hosted games for the 2010 World Cup.</p>

            <p>In relation to its historical role, several respondents pointed to its importance as a drawcard for
                tourism. The SMME forum manager replied:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Orlando East has the unique feature of its historical role in the apartheid era. This has provided
                    the basis for tourism, OE’s biggest industry. Tourism could be expanded much more.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another respondent also pointed to the importance of key events in the area:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Politics is #1. Orlando Communal Hall is where the break between the ANC and Pan-Africa Congress
                    parties happened – a major political event in the 1950s. 1960s race riots – apartheid is the
                    “history of Orlando East”.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Closely related to the area’s history is the prominence of sport – highlighted by the Orlando Stadium,
                the largest and most clearly visible building in the area. As one respondents put it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Things that attract people are the soccer stadium. E.g. Williams sisters were here. Used to have a
                    tennis court – caretaker did not allow practices there. Swimming pool. Could be a diversity of
                    sports interests.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Other respondents gave mixed responses. Some pointed to the lack of change and closure of facilities
                motivating people to leave, to ‘go to greener pastures’. On the other hand, Orlando East continued to
                attract migrants from the rest of Africa and parts of South Africa. Several respondents referenced the
                quality of ‘Ubuntu’, a concept that references the importance of community and ‘love for one another’,
                as a feature of Soweto that brings people back to visit or stay in the community.</p>

            <h5><a href="#orlando-a-modest-investment">A Modest Investment…</a></h5>

            <p>Question ED22 asked a hypothetical question about investment: ‘If you had R 1000 to invest, how would you
                use this to maximise the benefit for you and your family? Has the World Vision project changed how you
                would use this money now compared to 3 years ago?’</p>

            <p>The small business operators we asked suggested they would invest the money in their business, buying new
                equipment or experimenting with new products. One respondent suggested he would ‘put 500 in bank; [and
                use the] other 500 to improve business’. The SMME Forum manager used the question to describe the
                difficulties many without financial literacy experience when dealing with money:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>How a windfall of R1000 would be used would depend on who received it. ‘Rich people buy assets, poor
                    people buy things.’. There is a great lack of awareness regarding financial management, banking and
                    debt. There is a need to increase financial literacy. People get credit - then debt. Don’t
                    understand bank accounts [or the] value of owning property over debt. Education needs to be
                    early.</p>

    <h3><a href="#orlando-partner-results">Partner Results</a></h3>

    <p>Partnering is considered a foundational part of the Orlando East project, and of World Vision’s Urban Programming
        generally. Accordingly, although project partners in this instance had much to say of interest about the Orlando
        East community and its challenges, we restrict discussion of the partner interviews to questions to those that
        relate to partnering and networking. As we discuss below, these do however relate closely to broader issues of
        the Sowetan urban environment.</p>

    <p>A total of 21 qualitative or open-ended questions were constructed around the partnership theme. As with the
        community and staff surveys, not all questions were deemed relevant in all instances, and we noted considerable
        overlap in any case between similarly worded questions. Because of this repetition, we have consolidated
        responses around a series of more general partner themes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>General nature and assessment of the partnership (questions 31-33, 44, 47)</li>
        <li>Financial arrangements (questions 34-36)</li>
        <li>Procedural arrangements (questions 37-40, 49)</li>
        <li>World Vision’s role (questions 45-46; 48; 50-51)</li>
        <li>Recommentations (questions 52a)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The findings are discussed below against these themes.</p>

    <div class="section level4" id="orlando-general-nature-and-assessment-of-the-partnership">
        <div class="section level4">
            <h4><a href="#orlando-general-nature-and-assessment-of-the-partnership">General nature and assessment of the
                partnership</a></h4>

            <p>Partner respondents were positive about the collaborative and equity aspects of their relationship with
                World Vision. One organisation, <em>Dependable Strengths</em>, felt its recent relationship with World
                Vision had been mutually beneficial:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Yes. Partnership has furthered both partner goals. [The partner had observed that:] 1. WV connects
                    young people to other services 2. People can go to the next level in the job market</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Similarly, an HIV/AIDS care facility operated by a community-based organisation called Footprints felt
                that World Vision was an essential ‘pillar in the community’, both providing essential items like
                medicine trolleys and wheelchairs, and acting as a broker to connect the organisation with other
                partners.</p>

            <p>Two partners expressed the concern that while their goals were shared, it was difficult to realise those
                goals due to resource constraints. One partner, the local Fire Department, suggested ‘would be
                preferable if WV covered a larger physical area’.</p>

            <p>Overall, though, respondents were confident that their current partnering arrangements with World Vision
                shared common goals. They also agreed these arrangements were largely on a equitable basis.</p>

            <p>There was some difference in interpretation around this question through; a number of respondents
                considered ‘equity’ in the context of broader community and partner network context. In some cases, this
                brought out points of criticism. For example, the manager of the Victim Empowerment Unit complained
                specifically about the lack of support offered by the South African Police Service (SAPS). In the
                context of the work her unit is responsible for, ‘police support [is] critical to provide security’. Two
                other partners, both affiliated with community organisations, suggested there was a problem with gender
                equity and representation. This suggests that World Vision has an ongoing role in advocating and
                addressing equity issues within the broader partnering context.</p>

            <p>In response to question 33, ‘what are the most important elements of a good partnership?’, respondents
                raised a number of themes: common goals; open communication and transparency; mutual recognition and
                support; acknowledgement of how all partners benefit; and, in the words of one respondent, ‘allowing
                partners to grow both horizontally and vertically’. Question 44 elicited similar responses; here all
                respondents mentioned the importance of having a ‘clarification of roles’ and ‘a common vision’. One
                respondent also spoke of the importance of having this backed up by ‘low level’ activities, such as
                attending eachother’s events and talking about ‘achievements and challenges’.</p>

        <div class="section level4">
            <h4><a href="#orlando-financial-arrangements">Financial arrangements</a></h4>

            <p>Responses to the questions about funding and finances were quite limited. In most cases, the partnerships
                appeared to be largely non-financial; World Vision contributed mostly in-kind support, with occasional
                funding for particular workshops or events. Partners were generally concerned about the lack of
                resources; the Early Childhood Development group noted one example of the difficulties of multilateral
                funding arrangements, when ‘a building material supply company withdrew its offer of building materials
                when it realised the amount of materials required for a particular schools project’. None of the
                partners saw World Vision’s role as a funding partner.</p>

            <h4><a href="#orlando-procedural-arrangements">Procedural arrangements</a></h4>

            <p>Questions 37-40 and 49 examined the process by which the partnership(s) had been formed. Question 37
                asked whether roles are clearly defined. All respondents were agreed emphatically that this was the
                case. One respondent claimed that ‘World Vision delivered on their promises’, while another stated:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The roles of World Vision and the Fire Department are clearly defined and understood.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Question 38 asked whether project planning processes were collaborative. Again respondents were
                unanimously in agreement. As one respondent put it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Yes; everybody from the top down has been part of the process. Things are discussed, sifted.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In their response to this question, Footprints, an organisation that offered hospital beds and treatment
                to HIV/AIDS sufferers, outlined a process where they shared an annual Strategic Plan with partners. This
                seemed to facilitate greater awareness of their mission, and foster stronger collaboration with
                partners.</p>

            <p>Question 39 asked whether, and how often, meetings were held between partners to discuss issues and
                challenges. This elicited a range of responses, from ‘there are frequent meetings held between the two
                partners’ to ‘meetings between the partners are not frequent’. In the remaining cases, it appeared that
                there had been a number of initial face-to-face meetings, followed by sporadic or monthly phone calls.
                One respondent stated the World Vision team was ‘just a phone call away’; another suggested ‘they will
                come to us, when they need us’.</p>

            <p>Question 40 asked whether Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) stategies had been agreed upon between
                partners. Again this elicited a range of responses, from ‘there are no formal monitoring and evaluation
                procedures in place yet’ to ‘yes we do agree on monitoring a specific project that we will be doing’. In
                most cases, it appeared that <em>project</em> reporting activities are extensions of existing
                organisational reporting activities, and therefore reflected extrinsic characteristics such as
                organisational maturity, resources and priorities. In several cases, partners expressed a desire to
                document particular models or processess, in order that their work be recognised and replicated. This
                was evocatively captured in the description given by the Program Manager of PlanAct:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This model needs to be documented and shared, to replicate. Have been approached to facilitate in
                    other areas (of Joburg). Beginning to see ‘spin offs’ in the local area. Using local newspaper to
                    get the message out.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Question 49 asked respondents how formal they considered the partnership to be. Two out of four responses
                stated the relationship was informal, as nothing had been provided in writing. In other two cases, some
                kind of written agreement or MOU existed. Anecdotal feedback from other partners suggested that there
                was a roughly even split between formal and informal arrangements in place.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level4" id="orlando-world-visions-role">
        </div>
        <div class="section level4">
            <h4><a href="#orlando-world-visions-role">World Vision’s role</a></h4>

            <p>Overall, although these responses were aimed at understanding the nature of the partner network
                generally, they strongly suggest that World Vision is held in very high regard, as a partner that is
                reliable, organised, inclusive, consultative and available. Questions 45, 46, 48, 50 and 51 broadly
                examine World Vision’s role in the project and associated partnerships, with a particular focus on the
                future sustainability of projects and partnerships.</p>

            <p>Question 48 asked respondents to describe World Vision’s role in relation to the project and, more
                broadly, to the local community. All six respondents to this question used either the words
                ‘facilitator’ or ‘catalyst’. This was linked to other roles World Vision was assumed to play: as a
                keeper of ‘institutional memories’; as a trusted source in the community; as an organiser of
                opportunities and operator of programs.</p>

            <p>Question 45 asked how World Vision had specifically facilitated the development of partnerships, and
                capacity building of the partner network in the area. Respondents described a very broad range of roles
                and actions World Vision had undertaken. These include both direct economic development activities –
                helping to create businesses, and developing financial and practical skills, particularly among young
                people – as well as auxiliary work in assisting creches and churches, and advocating for specific issues
                such as child abuse.</p>

            <p>Question 50 asked whether the ‘community network’ existed before World Vision’s involvement. This
                question did not prove to be especially relevant, as in most cases World Vision had been instrumental in
                creating a ‘community network’ through the partnership itself. The Fire Department did reply:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Previous to working with WV, the Fire Department worked with local councillors. They also partner
                    with Nelson Mandela Children Fund to raise awareness on the dangers of fire.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Questions 46 and 51 both relate to the future sustainability of work done through the partnership
                arrangement. Question 46 asked how World Vision is preparing network partners for for future financial
                autonomy. All partners agreed that World Vision had been actively promoting autonomy; as one respondent
                put it, ‘they implement something and give it to the community to carry on’. Another partner appeared
                concerned that since their project involved ‘working with people with no money’, they found it ‘very
                difficult’ and were ‘hoping for finance, to spend money on training’. In general, the more established
                the partner, the more capable they seemed of continuing their work without World Vision’s support.
                Footprints stated that ‘World Vision has advised several times on the need for self-sufficiency’ – and
                elaborated on a series of measures they had adopted in current and subsequent plans to increase their
                financial independence. Such measures included training other organisations; delivering services;
                andsupplying commercial companies with gardening produce such as peas and carrots.</p>

            <p>Question 51 asked, more directly, ‘If WV was removed today from the network, would it be self-sustaining?
                If so, why do you think this is? If not, why not?’ This brought a more diverse range of responses. One
                partner thought World Vision had already helped people ‘to fend for themselves’, and that community
                could ‘not expect people to be given things’. Another felt this would ‘be fair for the communities’, but
                at the same time expressed the view that ‘if World Vision is removed we will be blind because World
                Vision is our eyes in the community’. Two other respondents stated that their projects were not yet
                self-sustaining. As the manager of Footprints put it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Have not reached that stage yet. This is a process of working with people. Invest five years of time
                    in this project.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our limited observations during the week concurred with this view. As we discuss in the analysis below,
                World Vision continues to play a foundational and formative role in the community projects and
                partnerships it has initiated.</p>

            <p>Questions 52a, 100a and 101 asked respondents to propose recommendations, to reflect on past achievements
                and to state their future goals for the partnership and project.</p>

                    <p>Questions 52a asked specifically ‘do you have any recommendations about ways World Vision could
                        improve how it works with partners in this project?’ The main response was to expand the
                        operational scale and geographical reach of World Vision in the area. One respondent felt that
                        through the partnership, more could be done for ‘orphans and vulnerable children and to [combat]
                        child abuse’. Another suggested relocating the World Vision office more centrally, as ‘there is
                        a challenge of going up there’.</p>

                    <p>In response to question 100a, concerning past achievements, all respondents were able to outline
                        particular goals that had been met. The <em>Womens Forum</em>, a small co-operative, emphasised
                        ‘providing training and skills to local people’. <em>Thlokomelo</em>, a child protection
                        organisation operating out of the same premises as World Vision, outlined its growth from being
                        ‘based in a shack’, without a ‘kitchen with running water’, to an important provider of food and
                        social work services for children. <em>Footprints</em> stated its most signicant achievement had
                        been the opening of the hospice. <em>Dependable Strengths</em>, a training organisation based in
                        downtown Johannesburg, had conducted three training sessions with the support of World Vision,
                        and found, after surveying 37 attendees:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>13 had gained employment</li>
                        <li>7 were studying further</li>
                        <li>4 initiated businesses (in tourism, hairdressing)</li>
                        <li>9 were involved in community work (stipendry), with organisations such as the YMCA</li>
                        <li>only 4 had had no progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, other partners emphasised less tangible but not less critical achievements: raising
                        awareness and advocating on behalf of child abuse victims, and building relationships and
                        improving communication with the community.</p>

                        the next 3 years?’. This question was asked of all partners, and elicited a wide range of
                        responses – some focussed on community impact, others addressing aspects of the partnership. As
                        these responses shed light on the broader challenges of the community, they are quoted or
                        paraphrased at length.</p>

                    <p>The <em>Womens Forum</em> stated they would like their work to be recognised throughout South
                        Africa. To achieve that, they are looking to market themselves, as well as to partner with
                        others. To do so, they need greater specificity of skills and training.</p>

                    <p><em>Thlokomelo</em> stated that their vision is focussed on children and young people. In their
                        words:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Would like to see them start businesses, to improve themselves and the community. Do 3 years
                            of university. SA short of engineers; would like to see area produce an engineer, doctor,
                            maybe even the PM. Professionals work from the ground to the top.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The <em>Victim Empowerment Unit</em> saw the most important goal as being the alleviation of
                        poverty through job creation. The manager stated she ‘would like to see people having long-term,
                        sustainable jobs and healthy lifestyles’. To do so, they ‘need to be educated - Educate,
                        educate, educate’. However this goal was currently being compromised by unstable project
                        resourcing and corruption.</p>

                    <p><em>Dependable Strengths</em> articulated tremendous confidence in thier specific training
                        program. Participants experienced ‘a transformation in the room’, and got ‘hooked on the
                        program’. The managers of the business expressed a desire to ‘change South Africa one person at
                        a time’; they were looking to scale up the program and ‘roll [it] out throughout the country’.
                        They hope to continue the relationship with World Vision, acknowledging that this ‘all depends
                        on finance’.</p>

                    <p><em>Footprints</em> stated that their most pressing goal was ‘to be able to sustain ourselves’.
                        They felt World Vision was providing constructive advice for ‘working towards that’.</p>

                    <p><em>Pikitup</em>, a waste management company, aimed to increase education about waste and the
                        environment, particularly among children. In their words, ‘a cleever child will educate the
                        parent’. To do so, they want to build a team of professionals in the environmental field. They
                        also hope to expand the relationship with World Vision over the next three years.</p>

                    <p><em>PlanAct</em> expressed a desire to ‘create opportunities for people to have their livelihoods
                        secured’. They hoped to commence a new project with World Vision to help facilitate this.</p>

                    <p>In spite of the diversity of goals, all partners hoped to continue to expand their relationship
                        with World Vision in the future.</p>

            <h4><a href="#orlando-project-design-monitoring-and-evaluation-dme">Project Design, Monitoring and
                Evaluation (DM&amp;E)</a></h4>

            <p>Staff had several reflections on DM&amp;E experiences in the Orlando East project with implications for
                urban programming.</p>

            <p>During the assessment and design phase, it was suggested than an ‘environmental scan’ be carried out to
                ensure that new projects do not duplicate what others are already doing. The pre-existing activities of
                other local actors should be mapped against the objectives set for any new project. A ‘group-based’
                targeting approach was also suggested, rather than conventional methods of working at an individual or
                household level. It was considered key to be working with networks and ‘big forums’ in order to have a
                stronger shared voice in negotiating with the City of Johannesburg government. To this end, the Orlando
                East project has tried to ‘use different approaches for different communities’, and prioritise the most
                vulnerable organisations over the more developed ones. There is a greater emphasis on ‘small’ partners
                whom the project ‘treats as equals.’</p>

            <p>According to staff, project timeframes need to be sensitive to stakeholders in the urban context. There
                was a sense of a demonstrative element required in World Vision work, such that:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>People want to see something come up first before they want to be part of what we are doing.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This reflection would appear to support the concept of a single-issue urban entry project that builds
                trust and relationships with local stakeholders in a shorter span of time.<sup><a href="#orlando-fn25">25</a></sup>
            </p>

            <p>In the case of Orlando East, a period of six months was required simply to ‘adapt and understand the
                context.’ The following two years were required to ‘get the project running’. One staff member
                recommended a greater frequency of redesign events (annual), to cater for changes in the urban
                environment such as movement of local people.</p>

            <p>Learning and reflection activities involving staff, and also community members and partners, were
                considered a fundamental aspect of urban program implementation. One staff member described it as
                such:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When you are involved in the game, you cannot be the referee. You need someone to stop the game and
                    talk about the rules.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Staff members appreciated opportunities to reflect on their experiences, and were particularly concerned
                with the documentation of lessons. Monthly monitoring and semi-annual reporting (as part of the LEAP
                cycle) was considered an opportunity to reflect on lessons – with community members as well as
                staff.</p>

            <p>Finally, the accountability element of DM&amp;E was seen as valuable to keep projects focused, however
                LEAP was seen as a toolkit that should be ‘adaptive and flexible’ when needed. One suggestion was that
                the logframe as a tool is ‘not suitable’ for urban contexts, and was considered ‘too rigid with too many
                assumptions’ being made about urban issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level4" id="orlando-child-well-being-in-urban-contexts">

        <div class="section level4">
            <h4><a href="#orlando-child-well-being-in-urban-contexts">Child Well-being in urban contexts</a></h4>

            <p>Staff considered the project to be making ‘indirect’ contributions to child well-being, with a stated
                frustration that, to achieve the outcome chosen from the Compendium (‘Children educated for life’),
                ‘there are many things that you have to get through in between.’ ‘Friendly spaces for children to learn,
                such as early childhood development’(ECD) centres, were suggested as an important contribution that
                urban ’projects could make to child well-being.</p>

            <p>One staff member also suggested that a single issue focus could actually have a deeper impact on overall
                child well-being – ‘doing one thing and doing it good’. This reflects the fact that the Community
                Development Committee (CDC) – initially approached to work on economic development – has diversified
                into sub-groups that are also addressing issues of child protection, education, health and positive
                relationships in the community.</p>

            <p>It was agreed among staff interview respondents that child sponsorship was not suitable for application
                in urban contexts, predominantly due to mobility in the target community. It should be noted, however,
                that more detailed data on the specific challenges of child sponsorship in urban was not gathered during
                these interviews.<sup><a href="#orlando-fn26">26</a></sup></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level4" id="orlando-partnering">
        </div>
        <div class="section level4">
            <h4><a href="#orlando-partnering">Partnering</a></h4>

            <p>‘Development as partnership’ is a theme that consistently emerged from the staff interviews. The approach
                of the Orlando East project is not considered to be a collection of direct interventions, but rather a
                case of ‘working through partners’ wherever possible. A practical example of financial partnering
                between organisations in Orlando East was given as equitable sharing of payments for activities or
                services - ‘50/50 with big organisations’. In these arrangmements, no cash changes hands between partner
                organisations.</p>

            <p>During the interviews with staff there was a repeated emphasis on the intangible nature of urban
                projects, such that:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>People want to come and see – but sorry we don’t have a vegetable garden. If you don’t have those
                    things, [the question is asked] what are you doing? This is the whole issue of facilitation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It became clear that throughout the course of these interviews that although urban facilitation and
                partnering were well understood at the field or project- level, there is a need for a better
                understanding of the implications within World Vision at other levels. This is also reflected in the
                results from questions on organisational systems (see below).</p>

            <h4><a href="#orlando-role-of-world-vision">Role of World Vision</a></h4>

            <p>The role of World Vision in Orlando East is variously described as ‘working through partners,’
                ‘coordination,’ ‘connecting and facilitating,’ ‘education’ and ‘advocacy’. All of these descriptors
                would seem to be valid, as the World Vision project staff play a variety of roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>linking and referring community members to available services</li>
                <li>raising the profile of community-based organisations and welfare groups</li>
                <li>providing a shared platform for disparate groups to meet and work together on common objectives</li>
                <li>improving the flow of information between the various individuals and groups present in Orlando
                    East.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>On a daily basis, staff activities were described as consisting of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>hosting and running meetings for the purposes of planning, or reporting on progress</li>
                <li>participating in public events or gatherings</li>
                <li>conducting clear and transparent communication with project stakeholders (telephone or email)</li>
                <li>providing advice or responding to enquiries from local residents, which might result in referrals to
                    service providers, or contacting local authorities e.g. police
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At face value these activities might seem somewhat banal but in fact are conducted with a high degree of
                sensitivity to stakeholder interests and requirements, political undertones, and underlying ethical
                considerations such as equity and the inclusion of marginalised groups.</p>

            <p>Trust, transparency and ‘openness’ were operating principles also repeated by several staff members:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A lot of maturity is needed to do this work… [and] you can’t afford to stop communicating even on the
                    little things.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In addition, a core staff competency is the ability to ‘understand urban politics’, especially the ways
                in which government officials carry out their work. Staff considered the act of linking local residents
                to their government representatives to be a value-adding role of the project. Community members were
                seen to be generally ‘pulling back’ from government processes, unless there is a perceived gain or
                benefit to be made. Volunteerism in the community is also low.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Before this project there was no platform to engage in a healthy and active way; in a way that
                    appreciates constraints and challenges on both sides. The project helps them knock on right doors
                    and be in contact with the right people.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>By extension, holding government to account for its responsibilities was also seen as critical for the
                Orlando East project:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Our role is to ensure that government is in the picture, delivering services to the people, doing
                    what they are supposed to be doing.</p>

            <h4><a href="#orlando-local-economic-development">Local Economic Development</a></h4>

            <p>The context of Orlando East and Soweto was seen by staff to be more conducive to economic development
                programming, due to the high turnover of cash, services and goods in the urban economy.</p>

            <h4><a href="#orlando-sustainability">Sustainability</a></h4>

            <p>The project’s efforts were considered to be having a positive impact on institutions that will exist
                after World Vision leaves the area. Working through networks and ‘big forums’ was also seen to be a key
                factor in strengthening sustainability of the project.</p>

            <p>According to staff, one of the most important objectives the project could have in the near-term is
                training and building the capacity of partners to ensure sustainability. For example, the ability to
                ‘resource funding’ through proposal- writing was raised as an important local skill, coupled with the
                need to:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Inform partners that we are not here as donors, we are here as partners.</p>
            </blockquote>

                processes</a></h4>

            <p>According to respondents, facilitation as an activity does not translate well into World Vision systems,
                especially finance. Finance process requirements are considered by staff to be overly bureaucratic, and
                inflexible to the demands of the project context. A repeated example, small but not insignificant, was
                the provision of refreshments during meetings with partners. The approval process for this expense was
                considered too long and cumbersome, despite how frequently it is required.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Your bill for the month is food and petrol – I am asked ‘what is it that you are doing?’ When you are
                    building capacity, or going to meetings, that is your expense. In urban space you don’t focus on the
                    physical.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In addition, internal finance policies were seen to be constantly changing and poorly communicated,
                adding to the difficulties in managing urban project budgets effectively.</p>

    <p>In spite of this expected overall correspondence, the relative frequency of certain themes is of interest. Both
        ‘Youth and Children’ and ‘Government Services and Engagement’ themes, for instance, are reflected in the
        questions but features heavily in the responses. Nearly all respondents referenced various kinds of government
        engagement, whether explicitly prompted to or otherwise, and the need to train and encourage youth also featured
        prominently. Similarly, the themes of ‘Information and Comunication’ and ‘Education, Skills and Training’
        featured very prominently and often in connection with economic development. Certain themes were also often
        mentioned in the context of constraints on economic development. Here, ‘Mobility and Transport’, ‘Food and
        Housing Security’, ‘Health and Wellbeing’, ‘Accountability and Corruption’ and ‘Security, Safety and Crime’
        stand as abstract codes to represent a series of practical issues that arose again and again: lack of transport
        routes to work sites; poor food and housing conditions (particularly over-crowding in backyard ‘shacks’); the
        devastating impacts of HIV/AIDS, particularly on Soweto residents of working age; government corruption; and
        basic personal security.</p>

            <p>Community participants were asked 12 questions that could be scored quantitatively. In each case a
                ten-point rating scale was used to measure respondents’ attitudes to a range of variables, with a
                midpoint of 5.5. These variables correspond to major themes in the UMF in 9 cases, and relate to
                economic development in the remaining 3. Table 1 shows the codes and wording of each question, along
                with the number of responses, and the mean, minimum, maximum and range of those responses. In all cases,
                the number of responses was less than the number of community participants; in many cases, interviewers
                felt the question was either not relevant to the participant, or there was insufficient time to cover
                that thematic area in the interview. In some other cases, quantitative scores could not be obtained due
                to the difficulties of explaining the scoring process through a translator. Combined with the overall
                sample size, this means the results are at best indicative of general community attitudinal trends that
                could be confirmed through larger studies or with reference to other statistical sources.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, both item means and ranges offer useful points for further consideration in relation both
                to the Orlando East and other pilot reviews. Perceptions about the World Vision project (Q28, Q62, Q70,
                ED8) are consistently positive, i.e. above the mid-point; while perceptions about the community’s sense
                of rights and government accountability (Q60, Q63) are negative. Notwithstanding potential bias of those
                we spoke to, this could be taken as an indication that World Vision is viewed as a more trusted and
                beneficial authority in the community than government. Qualitative responses certainly confirm these
                suggestions. Another surprising result is that average responses to Q25 (perception of community
                poverty) is above the mid-point, but not by much. This is contradicted by the qualitative results.</p>

            <p>The wide ranges of responses to certain items (Q28, Q58, Q62, Q70, ED8) could be interpreted as
                indicating disagreement about these items. However this likely also reflects the lack of clear anchors
                (e.g. what is the meaning of “1” and “10” in each case) and ambiguity about the meaning of key terms
                (“community”, “government”, “project” in particular). These difficulties are addressed in the <em>Lesson
                    Learnt</em> section below.</p>

            <p>To explore any relationships, we conducted bivariate correlation tests on all variable pairs. Several
                significant results of interest emerged: for instance, “community’s ability to engage with government
                processes” correlated extremely highly with “government accountability to the poor in the community”.
                While these are likely to be artefacts of extremely small sample sizes, they are also suggestive of
                relationships that could be tested with larger samples. This is particularly relevant, as discussed
                below under Lessons Learnt, to establishing relationships between dependent and independent variables in
                projects’ Theories of Change.</p>

            <p>The <em>Partner Analysis Tool</em> is a generic instrument used by VicHealth and was trialled as part of
                the Partner Survey. We administered the tool to five out of eight partners (in the remaining three cases
                we either ran out of time or did not consider the tool appropriate to use in the context). The tool
                includes 35 Likert items, scaled from 1 (“Strongly disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly agree”), grouped in the
                following seven stages of partnership development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Determining the need for the partnership</li>
                <li>Choosing partners</li>
                <li>Making sure partnerships work</li>
                <li>Planning collaborative action</li>
                <li>Implementing collaborative action</li>
                <li>Minimising the barriers to partnerships</li>
                <li>Reflecting on and continuing the partnership</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The tool suggests three “bands” for interpreting the aggregate scores of the tool:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>35-84 The whole idea of a partnership should be rigorously questioned.</p>

                <p>85-126 The partnership is moving in the right direction but it will need more attention if it is
                    going to be really successful.</p>

                <p>127-175 A partnership based on genuine collaboration has been established. The challenge is to
                    maintain its impetus and build on the current success.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The average aggregate scores for the five participants was 139, comfortably in the top band suggesting
                that a “partnership based on genuine collaboration has been established”. Only one respondent rated the
                partnership in the middle band of “it will need more attention if it is going to be really successful”.
                In this case additional qualitative evidence made it clear this was because the “partnership” in this
                case referred to a multilateral rather than bilateral relationship, and the respondent was quite
                critical of work done by one of the other partners (the SA police). This reflects a difficulty
                concerning whether the underlying construct being measured by World Vision under “partnering” relates to
                a specific one-to-one relationship between World Vision and a given interviewee, or to a broader notion
                of “partner network”. Several draft survey questions used the term “network”; however in piloting we
                discarded the term, since most of the relationships were in fact bilateral–meaning that World Vision
                seems to function, in this project, as the centre hub around which other organisations form
                relationships, rather than just one node or point on a network.<sup><a href="#orlando-fn27">27</a></sup>
                While the network idea is attractive–particularly from the point of view of establishing sustainability
                beyond World Vision’s own involvement in the project–in this project it is yet to be realised. One
                possibility, stemming from these observations, is to develop a specific indicator to measure the
                maturity of the network itself. In cases, like Orlando East where World Vision is for the most part the
                lead partner in a two-way partnership arrangement, this may suggest a relative lack of maturity.
                Improving upon this maturity would be a worth side aim or goal of building capacity at both community
                and partner levels.</p>

    <p>The findings offer a rich set of insights into the general and economic challenges faced by the Orlando East
        community. As the first time that World Vision’s Urban Meta-analysis Framework (UMF) has been trialled as a
        conceptual tool for developing questions and indicators, they also provide valuable insights into future
        directions of urban programming reviews and evaluations. In this section we summarise key findings and explore
        implications for both the Orlando East project and other urban projects.</p>

    <p><!--| John's suggestion
                  As with the findings, the *Analysis* section is divided into several sections.
                  First we discuss the findings directly -- what they show about the Orlando East
                  context and the specific impacts of the local economic development work
                  undertaken by World Vision. We include in that discussion specific subsections
                  that cover the economic data collected, and we also comment on comparisons
                  between this and the baseline report conducted in 2010. Secondly we examine the
                  methodology of the review, including limitations and potential improvements for
                  subsequent reviews. Thirdly, we discuss the broader question of how to
                  undertstand development in and urban context in the light of these findings.
                  This relates to the issue of methodology also, since the *Urban Meta-analysis

            <h3><a href="#orlando-discussion-of-community-findings">Discussion of Community Findings</a></h3>

            <p>The community findings show that, on the whole, and in spite of considerable signs of resilience and
                optimism in the community, life in Orlando East in 2012 remains difficult. The responses to questions
                about situational assessment, vulnerability and inequality drew out a range of specific concerns,
                including the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, drugs, crime, lawlessness and poverty. While no surprise to
                development practitioners in the area, this contrasts with the generally positive image conveyed of
                post-apartheid South Africa internationally.</p>

            <p>Such difficulties are further reflected in the generally despondent views towards both government and the
                Orlando East community. In particular respondents indicated a high level of concern with government
                inaccessability, lack of accountability, apathy and corruption. Although we had meetings scheduled with
                several council members from the local government, these were unfortunately cancelled – in hindsight the
                review would have benefited from responses from local government officials with direct accountability to
                the area. In spite of this, it is clear from other responses (as well as direct observation in the area)
                that government has a crucial and ongoing role in economic development in Orlando East. The prominence
                of ‘government’ in response to questions that didn’t directly ask about governance issues (especially in
                relation to the economic development questions) attests to this.</p>

            <p>In passing, we note the very specific role of Orlando East in the development of the ANC during the
                apartheid regime adds a particular poignancy to respondents’ observations concerning the lack of
                government support today. Numerous respondents talked with considerable pride about the recent history
                of the area, and indeed, ‘historic’ tourism is a noted form of economic growth. Despite many obvious
                signs of recent physical infrastructural improvements – not only the most prominent example of the
                Orlando East stadium, but also general upgrades to housing and roads – responses demonstrated a concern
                about the absence of less perspicuous, ‘soft’ urban infrastructure, particularly in the areas of
                education, health and transport. We note also that the current government has had less than 20 years in
                which to reverse the effects of systemic ‘undevelopment’ in the area, during which time both Orlando and
                Soweto generally has experienced significant population growth<sup><a href="#orlando-fn28">28</a></sup>.
                Nonetheless, both the participants’ responses and background data suggests there remains much that
                government actors, particularly, need to do to advance economic growth.</p>

            <p>World Vision itself seemed to be held in very high regard by those community members we interviewed –
                findings backed up by both the qualitative and quantitative results. Mean scores for questions about
                World Vision scored highly (7.33), while question relating to citizen rights and government
                accountability scored poorly (3.63; 3.80), relative both to other items and an expected mean of 5.5.
                From the qualitative feedback, World Vision were seen to be particularly helpful in relation to the
                issue of poverty. From the perspective of urban development, respondents who were aware of World
                Vision’s economic development project also had warmed to the different role it had played since closing
                down as an ADP and focussing on local economic development. Both World Vision staff were also highly
                respected. On the one hand, this is clearly pleasing from an organisational point of view; on the other,
                it poses a distinct problem in terms of the sustainability of the project beyond World Vision’s direct
                involvement and funding. We discuss this issue further in relation to the idea of a ‘partnership
                network’ in the <em>Partner</em> section below. We also note here that we see a very specific role World
                Vision can continue to play, given the high (and in the context, rare) level of trust it holds, in <em>advocating</em>
                on behalf of the community to government (at all levels).</p>

            <h3><a href="#orlando-discussion-of-partner-findings">Discussion of Partner Findings</a></h3>

            <p>Partner responses to qualitative questions show very strong support for their relationships with World
                Vision. This was reinforced by the five sets of responses to the <em>Partnership Assessment Tool</em>,
                where the average overall score was in the highest band of responses. Partners generally praised World
                Vision’s ability to operate equitable, well organised and mutually beneficial partnerships. This is
                testament not only to the general regard for World Vision, but also to the trust and respect engendered
                by the current team and project. Admittedly we only spoke to partners organised by the World Vision team
                itself, so results may be affected by a skewed or biased sample. Moreover, as we discuss below, a number
                of partners in this context are highly dependent on <em>any</em> support they can find, and are likely
                to be highly complementary of those that provide it. Nevertheless, World Vision team members were
                frequently not present during interviews, and responses seemed genuine rather than manufactured.</p>

            <p>The success cultivation of partnerships since the projects’ inception does lead to a curious and
                unintended problem of dependency. In the <em>Urban Meta-analysis Framework</em> we developed to guide
                the development of questions, a key concept is that of a “partner network”. In most cases in Orlando
                East, it appeared that partnerships were bilateral – between World Vision and another organisation –
                rather than multilateral. There were certainly cases where the ‘partner’ itself was a conglomerate of
                individuals, businesses and other organisations – this was the case for the various community forum
                representatives we interviewed for example. However, responses to questions 46 and 51 suggest that most
                of the partnerships are reliant upon World Vision as a facilitator, and indeed could not be sustained
                without its involvement. Interestingly, this is not because of direct funding. None of the partners had
                received financial support from World Vision. Rather it appears that the tremendous social and human
                capital an international NGO of World Vision’s size brings to the table – as well as its history in the
                area – is of immense importance to partners. Even more established organisations, such as Footprints and
                the SMME Forum, referenced occasions when World Vision had put them in touch with other organisations to
                deliver financial and training support.</p>

            <p>One way of imagining this role is through a network map of relationships. In 2009, the authors of the
                Baseline Report <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2010a)</span> conducted a network
                mapping exercise with the local Community Development Committee. This showed Government at the centre of
                the diagram (though the authors noted World Vision and PlanAct ‘currently mediated’ relationships
                between the Committee and government authorities). Though we did not conduct such an exercise as part of
                this review, we suspect a contemporary version would show World Vision being in the centre of such a
                diagram – at least for the partners we interviewed. Just as critically, World Vision appeared to also be
                an important facilitator of relationships between its partners, and the broader community and
                government. This may also reflect the changed role of WV since the inception of a single issue economic
                development project. Although not necessarily a desirable outcome (i.e. WV being at the ‘centre’ of a
                network) this might reflect a certain stage of project maturity, where in future WV could transition
                into a network ‘node’ rather than anchor.</p>

            <p>The idea that World Vision in practice occupies something of the facilitation role that local government
                should play in theory is not, however, particularly far fetched, as the community responses show. It
                does raise several pertinent questions, both in the Orlando East context and for urban programming in
                general:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How can World Vision transition a series of bilateral relationships into a multilateral network by
                    the completion of a project?
                </li>
                <li>Given the human resource intensivity of partnership and advocacy work, how can this kind of
                    programming model <em>scale up</em> (both within a project, and to other projects in related areas
                    and cities)?
                </li>
                <li>Is ‘project’ even a fitting description of the kind of engagement World Vision is making here?</li>
                <li>And to what extent, then, are conventional project management tools such as the logframe and
                    financial instruments appropriate for the conduct of such an engagement?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As we note in the analysis of staff findings, there has been some friction between the organisational and
                reporting requirements and the day-to-day practice of operating the project. We suspect this relates to
                the same kinds of issues, which we endeavour to dissect in greater detail in the discussion of urban
                programming and the meta-analysis framework below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section level3" id="orlando-discussion-of-staff-findings">

        <div class="section level3">
            <h3><a href="#orlando-discussion-of-staff-findings">Discussion of Staff Findings</a></h3>

            <p>In general, staff findings confirm observations from the community and partner interviews. Staff were
                similarly enthusiastic about the transition from child sponsorship to a focus on the single issue of
                economic development (“doing one thing and doing it good”), even if the links between the two seem at
                times tenuous (“there are many things have to get through in between”). All staff were able to point to
                specific achievements over the past three years that had contributed to both economic development and
                child well-being.</p>

            <p>However their deeper and more intimate knowledge of both the context and the project allowed for
                considerable reflective criticism of how World Vision engages with the urban environment. Two primary –
                and related – frustrations emerged in this respect:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Staff had difficulty showing <em>evidence</em> of progress due to the intangible, “soft” nature of
                    their work (“sorry we don’t have a vegetable garden”).<br/></li>
                <li>Staff also found it cumbersome requesting <em>funding</em> for the sorts of activities that
                    accompany partnering, facilitation and advocacy (“In the urban space you don’t focus on the
                    physical”).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As we touch on further below at a more abstract level, these frustrations relate strongly to the
                character of development work in cities. At a basic level, the Orlando East team of 2 are operating in a
                relatively small spatial zone comprising between 4 and 6 million people (in the greater Soweto). It was
                clear from all of the responses that the strategy of providing “soft” infrastructure – facilitation,
                partnering skills, advocacy – was the most practical way to effect transformation, both qualitatively
                and quantitatively, in the most vulnerable in the community. Relative to “hard” infrastracture (such as
                the cited “well” example), these activities are difficult both to measure and justify. Indeed, it is
                likely to be the case that indicators of project impact in these cases will be highly qualitative,
                difficult to measure and subject to varying interpretations – a point, again, we return to in the
                discussion of evaluation methodology below. It appears, in particular, that project staff would operate
                more effectively with a more flexible accounting regime, so long as the funded activities can be
                reconciled to project outcomes.</p>

            <p>Staff were less concerned about the actual DM&amp;E mechanisms (though logframe was criticised in this
                respect) for reporting on urban programming. Indeed responses showed an appreciation of the “forced”
                reflection these mechanisms encouraged. The lengthy initial “environmental scan” proved to be a useful
                way to understand the focus of the project, and how best World Vision could contribute. Given the
                frequent change in the environment, more frequent though smaller-scale scans and reviews would also be
                helpful, to hone and adjust the focus of the project over time (a process of such regular reviewing
                appeared to happen informally in any case). The staging of the World Cup in 2010 proved to be an
                important event of the sort that could also trigger adjustment of project methods.</p>

            <p>Despite the positive signs shown by the partnering work done by World Vision, there also remain questions
                concerning the sustainability of the partner network, along with the associated project outcomes. This
                is particularly the case regarding the “interface” between community and partners, on the one hand, and
                various government services, on the other. It seems that currently an NGO of World Vision’s standing
                plays a vital role in fostering this engagement, as well as a host of subsidiary partnering
                arrangements. At the risk of overstating World Vision’s significance, it is not clear, with our limited
                information, just who could be a similarly trusted, disinterested and connected community leader in its
                place. This of course creates a distinct difficulty for projects that are conspicuously constructed as
                ‘pilots’, with specified deadlines and exit strategies. We suggest, in our ‘Recommendations’, this needs
                to be a greater focus in this project particularly. One approach may be to explore the viability of a
                financially self-sustaining business modelled on the current World Vision project team, with operating
                costs provided in part or in whole by advisory fees and government grants, rather than by World Vision
                itself. Regardless of the mechanism, devolving community leadership in local economic development is an
                identifiable priority.</p>

            <p>One note of criticism regarding the current project design and implementation is that the outputs appear
                both numerous highly instrumental, particularly in relation to the partnering strategy. For example, the
                Project Design <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2012)</span> identifies Output 1.3 as
                ‘One Tourism Association and one existing Cleaning and Waste Management Cooperative strengthened through
                partnerships’. Other outputs are similarly definitive. We met with a wide range of partners – some local
                community groups, others small business owners, others again involved in child protection and other
                forms of service provision – and could imagine substantial time involved in basic co- ordination of
                activities across this range of organisations and industries. We also saw a commensurate range of
                capacities of partners – some operating at a subsistence level, others with sophisticated organisational
                structures and practices. Given time and resource constraints on the project team, it is possible that a
                more focussed approach – working with fewer partners, with perhaps a broader agenda and less
                prescriptive outputs in each case – would accomplish more. This would entail a much less ambitiously
                scoped project design and in the process may help reduce the evidentiary burden of reporting and
                budgetting described by staff above. Alternatively, this may constitute evidence that the project is
                ready to be scaled up, with more staff put in place to co- ordinate the many partner relationships more
                intensively.</p>

            <h3><a href="#orlando-discussion-of-the-coding-scheme-results">Discussion of the Coding Scheme Results</a>
            </h3>

            <p>While the resulting scheme has significant correspondences with the major themes and questions in the
                framework, it did manage to highlight some unforeseen areas, including those of interest to urban
                programming generally. Of the top twenty codes, for example, we expected themes like ‘Employment and
                Business Opportunity’, ‘Partnering and Networking’, ‘Youth and Children’, ‘World Vision’ and ‘Urban
                program effectives’ to dominate. More surprising are those areas that were seen to be obstacles to the
                project goal of economic development, and aim of child wellbeing. ‘Government Services and Engagement’
                is chief among these (and is further implicitly referenced in prominent themes of ‘Accountability and
                Corruption’, ‘Urban Environment and Infrastructure’ and ‘Resourcing’). This reinforces the view that the
                ‘government’ (at whatever local, state or national level this is construed) is deeply embedded in
                community and partner consciousness as a critical agent in the improvement of economic and other
                development outcomes. Currently it is not seen as sufficiently active in the pursuit of these goals.</p>

            <p>Other key themes that emerged from the coding exercise show the confluence of macro-level sociological
                factors in this setting. While we have no benchmark for comparison at this time, we note again that the
                project objectives, goals and aims here remain tightly interconnected with servicing basic needs in a
                range of areas. People need further ‘education, skills and training’ to prepare for employability and
                business development. ‘Information and communication’ channels need to be readily available to
                capitalise on economic opportunities. Communities need to be cohesive, ‘engaged and cooperative’ in some
                sense, for individuals to engage in flourishing production and consumption. Cost-effective and reliable
                ‘mobility and transport’ options need to be available for businesses, employees and consumers to trade
                effectively. And basic human physical and psychological needs, such as ‘food and housing’, ‘health and
                wellbeing’, reprieve from ‘poverty’ and ‘security [and] safety’ must be met for industrial productivity
                to grow.</p>

            <p>Again, we emphasise that understanding, much less acting upon, all of these issues is an insurmountable
                undertaking in a short period. Yet, from a developed urban perspective, we suspect a similar set of
                interviews would be unlikely to touch upon the same range of fundamental social issues in the context of
                economic development alone. The coding results – while driven to a degree by the line of questioning –
                add weight to the argument that World Vision is helping most precisely through its role as a trusted
                advisor of community and business, and its current orientation towards partnering, facilitation and
                advocacy is a practical – if somewhat intangible – means towards those broader social ends.</p>

                The <em>Baseline Report</em> draws upon community interviews, as well as network analysis and

                <em>Review</em> uses considerably different research instruments, and of course surveys different
                respondents. Nonetheless a high-level comparison of baseline and review data provides an opportunity to
                changes in the project and in the broader environment. We focus in particular upon the conclusions of

                    <p>The ‘Urban Vulnerabilities’ section describes the results of interviews with Orlando East
                        residents. It discusses many of the same issues identified here: insecurity of income; housing;
                        social tensions; crime; health; and poor governance. The ‘Project Approach’ section outlines on
                        early work to lead economic development, focusses particularly on a process called
                        ‘Participatory Appraisal for Competitive Advantage’, designed to fast-track local economic
                        development. The authors note in conclusion that at the time:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>There is also a significant degree of confusion around the focus on the poor in economic
                            development initiatives and a lack of clarity in WV’s approach to economic development. It
                            is apparent that there is a need for the articulation and alignment in WV on how economic
                            development links with Child Well-Being Outcomes and what role WV will play in promoting
                            economic development <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2010a)</span>.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>We return to this observation in the <em>Summary</em> below, and further in our <em>Recommendations</em>.
                        In the next section, ‘Project Outcomes’, the report describes existing and emerging
                        relationships with a number of partners. It includes a number interviewed here, including
                        PlanAct, Pickitup, the SMME Forum and the Economic Forum. The authors here note:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The pilot project team acknowledged that WV’s relationships with other organisations had not
                            yet reached the level of PlanAct or Pikitup. There were challenges experienced by WV in
                            engaging a wider group of committed partners and knowing what to offer and how to engage
                            each potential partner.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>It is clear from the range and depth of partner responses that the partner network has grown
                        considerably since. In our own <em>Recommendations</em> below, we actually argue that to some
                        degree that the partnering work needs to be more focussed on economic outcomes.</p>

                    <p>This section also acknowledges need to work on an ‘Improved Business Environment’, a ‘Pro-poor
                        Policy Environment’ and ‘Balancing economic development with social and spiritual wellbeing’. Of
                        specific relevance in the context of our review are the following points mentioned here (for
                        clarity we have converted these from prose to a list, and have put in bold key words for
                        emphasis):</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Findings have highlighted a number of <strong>competencies</strong> that are required by
                                staff working in urban programs and need to be further developed.<br/></li>
                            <li>Furthermore, urban programming has posed questions for <strong>design, monitoring and
                                evaluation systems</strong> in WVZAF that are yet to be resolved.
                            </li>
                            <li>This suggests that LED as the entry point for the project has been effective in <strong>mobilising
                                diverse community members</strong> towards action on a particular issue and valuable in
                                initiating development outcomes broader than economic deliverables.
                            </li>
                            <li>Findings of the qualitative research also suggest the need for a stronger <strong>advocacy</strong>
                                approach of the project in promoting greater accountability between government and
                                community groups in Orlando East.
                            </li>
                            <li>Findings also suggest the imperative for <strong>balancing economic development</strong>
                                with an underlying approach to <strong>strengthening social and spiritual
                                    well-being</strong>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Each of the terms emphasised above resonated strongly with our own findings. While the current
                        Project office staff have shown tremendous aptitude in the face of an extremely challenging
                        environment, we also note the need for stronger research, monitoring and evaluation skills. We
                        also have found repeatedly the the project has proven a galvanising vehicle for a range of
                        people, community groups and stakeholders to collaborate in the Orlando East area. We also have
                        found an extremely strong need for ongoing advocacy for the poor in the community. And finally,
                        the issue of economic development needs to be understood in the broader social context of
                        Orlando East, with its myriad of non-economic challenges.</p>

                    <p>Though of interest, we gloss over the next two sections and describe the ‘Conclusions and
                        Recommendations’. These included recommendations in five different areas:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Key recommendations for Orlando East Pilot Project</li>
                        <li>Key recommendations for Urban Programming</li>
                        <li>Key recommendations for economic development approaches</li>
                        <li>Key recommendations for evaluation processes</li>
                        <li>Other recommendations</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In broad terms, comparing the current review’s recommendations with the baseline reports shows
                        several points, both of similarity and difference, of interest. Firstly, we note some of the
                        same lack of clarity continues with regard to economic development, in particular concerning the
                        relationship to child wellbeing. At a general level, however, we have considerable sympathy with
                        those designing and implementing the project – it is far from clear from the broader development
                        literature exactly ‘what works’ with regard to fostering economic growth in developing regions.
                        Moreover the causal connection between growth and child wellbeing is both highly suggestive at a
                        statistical level (GDP, education and child mortality are all strongly correlated for example),
                        and notoriously hard to demonstrate with smaller sampling frames, due to a host of possible
                        confounds. It is therefore the sort of relationship which is both extremely plausible over the
                        long run, and extremely difficult to show progress with in the short run.</p>

                    <p>With respect to what <em>can</em> be demonstrated – that corrupt governance, excessive
                        bureaucracy, lack of education, poor physical and informational infrastructure, crime and
                        violence, health epidemics and gender inequality all acts as breaks on business development,
                        wealth creation and employment growth – the project seems to be correctly concentrating its
                        limited resources on “high yield” activities. These include the three ‘planks’ of activity of
                        advocacy, partnering and facilitation. The difficulty is in knowing <em>what</em> to advocate
                        for, partner around and to facilitate. In our view, the project has to date made modest but
                        significant progress in each of these areas. Numerous community participants spoke of World
                        Vision’s active role in consulting with government authorities, including the police, local and
                        federal authorities. The partner network has grown, in both depth and breadth. And there have
                        been a number of specific activities aimed at improving communication, information, education
                        and skills around business development and employment. We also acknowledge the symbolic
                        importance of World Vision’s presence in the area, as a trusted figure. In the light of
                        complaints about official authorities, the importance of this informal role should not be
                        underestimated.</p>

                    <p>However, we acknowledge in our own <em>Recommendations</em>, the project still needs greater
                        coordination around its principal theme of economic development. Of the original baseline
                        recommendations, the one we view as still being most applicable – and possibly the most
                        challenging – is the following:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The project team should consider how it responds to its broad focus – i.e. more staff, better
                            partnering or re-scoping the project.</p>

<h2><a href="#orlando-review-methodology">Review Methodology</a></h2>

<p>We discuss here several aspects of the review methodology. Some aspects of the methodology have been inherited from
    World Vision’s general DM&amp;E approach; other aspects have been trialled here for the first time.</p>

<div class="section level3" id="orlando-interviews">
<div class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#orlando-interviews">Interviews</a></h3>

    <p>The three interview scripts were prepared in the two weeks leading up to the interviews, and were piloted and
        refined on the Monday of the interview week. The economic questions devised by David Lansley proved to be easy
        to ask and explain in most cases, and showed relatively high response rates across the community participants
        (to whom they were largely directed).</p>

    <p>The framework questions were more difficult to ask, particularly those directed towards community participants.
        More critically, interviews proved to be useful ways of gathering information in relation to certain themes
        particularly: community members were able to answer questions on themes of “Levels of poverty &amp; Urban
        Vulnerabilities” and “Governance/ Power structures/ Accountability”, while partners responded to questions of
        “Partnering/ Networks/ Connections”. World Vision staff interviews covered a broader range of themes (both
        directly in response to questions, and indirectly through extensive and wide-ranging responses). Our questions
        though were naturally weighted towards themes that only WV staff could answer: “Partnering/ Networks/
        Connections”, “Program Effectiveness” and “Organisational systems &amp; structures”.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately two of the URBAN CONTEXT themes, “Diversity” and “Mobility”, were difficult to explore with any of
        the interview groups, other than in very generic terms. For example, findings show that diversity is growing in
        Orlando due to both southern migration in Africa and urbanisation of South Africans. Two of the small business
        operators happened to be from Mozambique; other respondents (confirmed by background literature) discussed
        growing populations from Zimbabwe and other countries in Soweto generally, which is leading to a greater need
        for infrastructure and housing. In the case of mobility, responses indicated several ways in which mobility is
        complicating economic development: as people move back and forth between urban and rural homes; as skilled and
        wealthier residents move to “the suburbs” (located primarily to the north rather than south of Johannesburg);
        and, as skilled labourers move from local to city- based locations (working for larger companies). Similarly,
        lack of mobility was cited as a problem in some cases, due to the time and expense of commuting outside Soweto.
        However both themes emerged from discussions rather than direct questioning. For these themes, as well as for
        the theme of “Levels of poverty &amp; Urban Vulnerabilities”, other sources of data are needed to analyse
        meaningfully any trends. This is discussed further in the <em>Mixed Methods Approach</em> and again in the <em>Recommendations
            for Review Methodology</em> sections below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3" id="orlando-quantitative-surveys">
</div>
<div class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#orlando-quantitative-surveys">Quantitative Surveys</a></h3>

    <p>We included in the surveys a number of questions requiring a response on a scale of 1-10. Given the overall
        sample of respondents was small, and further broken up into three categories, these are limited use for any
        statistical purposes (though they may shed light or clarify particular quantitative responses). We suggest, if
        feasible, that separate survey instruments be designed and administered to a larger sample in future reviews,
        using the current rating questions as a basis. This would accomplish several aims:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Questionnaires are quicker to administer than interviews, and could be administered as a separate process,
            and even by separate staff
        </li>
        <li>Larger samples (at least 20-30) would produce more statistically robust findings</li>
        <li>Findings could also be compared across pilot sites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The scales themselves also warrant greater refinement and scrutiny, in terms of both wording and the underlying
        constructs being measured. This is largely dependent upon the future direction of the Urban Meta-Analysis
        Framework generally; as that matures through further review iterations, the scales should be adjusted and
        elaborated upon accordingly. As a further point, the current literature on wellbeing and quality-of-life
        surveying is now both large and reasonably mature; it may be possible to investigate possible concordances
        between existing surveys and the aims of urban framework, and to pick up existing well-tested scales where
        appropriate (as indeed has been the case for the “Partnership Assessment Tool”).</p>

    <h3><a href="#orlando-testing-the-questions">Testing the Questions…</a></h3>

    <p>As we have noted, this review constituted an opportunity to trial a methodology and framework for understanding
        the impact of urban development. We had a number of difficulties translating high level concepts of ‘urbanism’
        and urban studies to a series of questions that were both relevant and understood by participants. We spent
        considerable time in the lead-up to, and on the first day of the review testing and refining the questions; even
        still, in practice, we found certain questions were more relevant and also easier to ask. This was particularly
        the case, surprisingly, for the World Vision staff interviews. The original staff survey was similar to the
        partner survey; after administering it to one staff member, we opted in favour of more open-ended and reflective
        questions reflected in the current survey. These probed the same sorts of themes and questions that are included
        in the urban meta- analysis framework, without the same level of prescription. As a side note, we felt that the
        “accidents” of cross-administering surveys (variations on the community survey was used with both a partner –
        the SMME forum – and a staff member) actually proved productive; however since the responses in both cases
        tended to confirm the overall trends, it would have been repetitive to continue with the same questions with
        other partner and staff participants.</p>

    <p>We list the community and partner survey questions in the <em>Survey Response Frequencies</em> appendix, in the
        order they appear in the framework, alongside the number of responses to each (where 1 or more response had been
        received). The table below shows all questions with more than 5 responses, ordered by frequency. Notwithstanding
        the fact the raw frequencies are skewed by the number of community members versus partner and staff
        participants, they provide a rough guide to the kinds of questions that “worked” in some sense. While we need
        further evidence that these questions remain relevant in other urban context, their frequencies are indicators
        of usefulness as general probes into general urban, partnering and organisational themes.</p>

    <p>We also note the difficulties with constructing generic questions. We tended to fare better with the economic
        development questions, in part because these were more directly related to both the context and the project. We
        therefore recommend that these more generic questions be thoroughly reviewed and adapted prior to each review.
        In particular, nouns that name social entities – like ‘government’, ‘community’, ‘partnership’, ‘youth’,
        ‘network’ – should be anchored to specific institutions, regions or demographics (for example: ‘your local
        government council’, ‘the business community in Orlando East’, ‘your partnership with World Vision’). This could
        accompany general preparation and orientation for interviewers in the pre-review period.</p>

    <h3><a href="#orlando-adopting-a-mixed-methods-approach">Adopting a Mixed Methods Approach</a></h3>

    <p>More generally, even in the limited time contexts of the pilot reviews, we would advocate for something of a
        ‘mixed methods approach’. We note in the <em>Baseline Report</em> that both network mapping and “Walk &amp;
        Talk” methods were used to supplement the project findings. Both activities could be, we believe, constructively
        employed during the reviews as well, even in truncated form, as part of the first day orientation for reviewers
        for example. More critically, they provide other sources of data against which to compare and constrast
        information given through obstrusive methods such as interviews and questionnaires.</p>

    <p>Similarly we suggest future reviews understand as much of the general urban context of a given pilot project as
        possible – through websites, films and other cultural forms, and academic and other publications. While the
        reviews generally won’t encompass scope for formal content analysis or ethnographic work, such secondary sources
        can be used profitably to orient and triangulate particular project findings. Moreover they help identify
        ‘macro’-social trends that may not be apparent through direct observation in the field. We suggest some
        particular data sources and methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Review of available government statistics and secondary literature (this is partially conducted in the
            current review for instance).</p></li>
        <li><p>Structured observation of the geographical area(s) and social behaviours addressed by the project. This
            could be particularly helpful with “Urban Context”-type questions concerning <em>Diversity</em>, <em>Mobility</em>
            and other themes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Anonymous paper or web-based questionnaires.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discourse or content analysis of documentary and media sources (newspapers, blogs, film, books, photos,
            maps, and other forms of cultural expression)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exactly how such activities should be conducted would need to be specified and adjusted for each project, but
        would ideally be factored into the review process ahead of time.</p>

    <h3><a href="#orlando-general-comments-on-methodology">General Comments on Methodology</a></h3>

    <p>We also note several aspects of the review methodology that either (a) worked well and so should be adopted or
        (b) could be improved for future reviews:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Interviewers and note-takers should be as familiar as possible with the review objectives and the
            specific interview questions, as well as general techniques and ethical considerations when conducting
            interviews. We include the generic instructions in the <em>Instructions for Interviewers</em> appendix used
            in the Orlando East review as a starting point for a more complete guide in future reviews.</p></li>
        <li><p>For each interview, participants should be given an <em>ethics package</em>, including: a ‘plain language
            statement’, outlining the purposes of the interview, a consent form detailing how the interview data will be
            used, and information about who they should contact with any concerns. While participants in the Orlando
            East context were briefed about these aspects, time constraints often meant details were omitted in
            practice. Again, the statement and consent form used in the Orlando East included in the <em>Interview
                Purpose and Consent Form</em> could be used as a template for future reviews.</p></li>
        <li><p>Where practical and appropriate, interviews should be recorded as well as noted. While transcription may
            often not be feasible, recordings can be used to confirm quotes during the report write-up.</p></li>
        <li><p>In Orlando East, the first afternoon was spent ‘role-playing’ interviews, with different people playing
            note-taker, interviewer and interviewee. We recommend this be adopted in future reviews, as it assisted us
            in identifying difficult- to-ask questions, and also introduced the review staff to the note-takers prior to
            actual interviews being conducted.</p></li>
        <li><p>Review staff should be briefed in the weeks leading up to the review about the project, interview
            schedule and participants. This was helpful in the Orlando East context; however, more details, particularly
            regarding the participants, would have allowed staff to be more precise in terms of the direction and focus
            of questions.</p></li>
        <li><p>As noted above, review staff should have some practical orientation (through relatively informal ‘Walk
            &amp; Talk’ and network mapping activities) prior to commencing interviews. Arriving one or two days ahead
            of time (e.g. on the preceding Friday or Saturday) would help with this.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the whole, the review process proved productive and certainly elicited critical insights and information.
        However we anticipate future reviews will benefit from a certain level of methodological pilotting undertaken in
        the Orlando East project.</p>

    <h2><a href="#orlando-development-in-the-urban-context">Development in the Urban Context</a></h2>

    <p>Given the economic focus of our questions, it is also not surprising that the themes of poverty, unemployment,
        resourcing and transport are raised frequently. This is evident both in the direct findings, and in our coding
        of responses, where ‘Employment and Business Opportunity’ appears with greatest frequency (191 occurrences).
        However the diversity of our respondents also brought out the complexity and interconnections of issues facing
        the community – and pointed to a general difficulty of formulating succinct and measurable ‘theories of change’
        in an urban environment. A particular example of this came out in discussion with the project manager of a child
        protection NGO operating in the area. She described how many of the children they cared for had been orphaned by
        parents dying of HIV/AIDS. As a consequence, these children lived with grandparents (particularly grandmothers),
        who often are past working age, living on pensions and are less connected with patterns of modern work life.
        Upon reaching adolescence, such children are faced with severely limited local employment opportunities and a
        lack of home-based vocational training. Gangs, crime and drugs provide natural avenues to absorb this excess
        labour capacity. In some cases, young women will contract HIV/AIDS intentionally, to apply for government
        support grants, and in the process, pertuating a vicious cycle. This particular anecdote highlights a number of
        themes – HIV/AIDS, drugs, crime, poverty, unemployment, child wellbeing – as well as, importantly, their
        interdependence.</p>

    <p>Such complex networks of factors clearly complicate the development agenda. Development projects naturally need a
        focus – arguably the focus of this project, ‘local economic development’, is already too broad given the
        resources on the ground. The theories of change posed both in the Baseline Report <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2010a)</span>
        and Project Design <span class="citation">(World Vision South Africa 2012)</span> documents, for example, posit
        a close causal connection between child wellbeing (‘Project Aim’) and economic development (‘Project Goal’). On
        the one hand, it is not clear that this causal link is justified in anything other than at an extremely high
        national level (where economic indicators have a strong correlation with general human development indicators
        for example). On the other hand, it is also clear that in the Orlando East context, numerous <em>other</em>
        factors are also integral. As the above anecdote indicates, <em>both</em> child wellbeing and economic
        development outcomes benefit from lower HIV/AIDS contraction rates, lower crime, better government
        accountability and greater education options. Where are interventions best directed?</p>

    <p>This reflects a more general issue that has received considerable attention in the development literature of
        late: “What works?” In urban contexts, this question is accentuated. Cities represent spatial configurations
        with high (though uneven) human density, mobility, opportunity, diversity, connectivity and levels of
        affiliation and relationships. Child well-being is accordingly impacted with greater intensity by dynamic and
        complex combinations of health, crime, employment, politics, transport, education and technology factors. Only
        in the most desparate and immediate circumstances will physical infrastructure (such as the example of the
        “well” mentioned by a staff member) be relevant in this context. Even then, such solutions are naturally costly
        to scale.</p>

    <p>In some respects the challenge of urban development programming seems to be one of accelerating the ‘natural’
        evolution towards the kinds of post- industrial democratic, relatively affluent and cosmopolitan cities that
        have achieved the prized status of ‘liveability’. As the nineteenth and twentieth century histories of cities
        such as London, Paris and Melbourne show, this is a hard-fought (and frequently non-linear) evolution. Nor, as
        numerous cities show, is such progress inevitable. While prescriptive recipes for successful cities have been
        difficult to identify (and moreover are usually overdetermined by political ideology), some of the controllable
        <em>obstacles</em> to development are more evident. A number of these indeed appear emphatically in our
        findings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Health impacts of manageable or eradicable disease</li>
        <li>Lack of education – particularly in areas of financial literacy, project and business management</li>
        <li>Government bureaucracy, “red tape”, inaccessability and corruption<br/></li>
        <li>Lack of co-ordination between community, business and government sectors</li>
        <li>Failure to identify and exploit economic comparative advantage</li>
        <li>Environmental hazards</li>
        <li>Inefficiencies brought about by lack of infrastructure and services</li>
        <li>High social and economic inequity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Focussing on negatives may work against the impulse of ‘transformational development’ espoused by NGOs like World
        Vision. Arguably they translate into more naturally into the promotion of ‘positive freedoms’ in an urban
        community context however. In the context of economic development, it is difficult for an NGO to advise
        communities how to generate profitable businesses for example. By discovering and endevouring to address what
        artificial <em>limits</em> are obstructing business and employment opportunities, individuals can at least
        experiment with what options the free market has to offer. For Orlando East, much of the practical work appears
        to be focussed precisely in this direction. We tentatively suggest that DM&amp;E activities be aligned; for
        example, by choosing indicators that reflect the removal of the kinds of systemic obstacles discussed above,
        rather than comparatively simple but unrepresentative measures such as the number of individuals who have been
        trained, found employment, founded businesses, and so on. While this might result in less ‘good news’ stories to
        tell, it would more correctly relate much of the important work World Vision had been able to achieve in this
        project.</p>

    <p>Towards this end, we now discuss the Urban Meta-Analysis Framework (UMF), put together by the Centre of Expertise
        in Urban Programming to guide DM&amp;E in the urban context.</p>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>

            <p>The Orlando East Project encompasses a broad range of economic development activities, centred on
                partnering, facilitation and advocacy. Given the challenges of the Soweto and South African environment,
                this is both a notable and complex undertaking. Our findings show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Orlando East is a highly complex urban environment. As part of Soweto, it is facing a swelling
                    population, particularly due to sub-Saharan and internal migration. It also continues to experience
                    high rates of HIV/AIDS, crime, child abuse, government corruption, skills and service shortages and
                    general poverty. Each of these is closely linked to the larger World Vision aim of improving child
                    wellbeing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Economic development is very uneven in Orlando East. While there are budding areas of
                    entrepreneurialism and more established markets in tourism, construction and in various informal
                    economic sectors, many community members still survive on substistence incomes. This economic
                    inequality contributes to broader social problems, and certainly affects child wellbeing
                    outcomes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Community members (and to a lesser degree, partners and WV staff) were critical of both local and
                    national government’s lack of action in promoting economic development. As a priority, increasing
                    information, skills and education (particularly in financial literacy) are critical to developing
                    business and employment opportunities.</p></li>
                <li><p>World Vision is a highly regarded ‘actor’ in the community. This is testament not only to the
                    organisation as a whole, but to the specific individuals involved in the project. The main
                    recommendation from review participants is that World Vision scale up its involvement both in
                    Orlando East and elsewhere in Soweto and South Africa.</p></li>
                <li>The UMF framework and methodology proved useful in extracting many of the complexities about the
                    environment and the project. Both can be productively enhanced in future reviews. In the Orlando
                    East context, for example, improvements include collecting data:
                </li>
                <li>from other parts of Soweto to better understand the unique characteristics of Orlando East</li>
                <li><p>and from other parts of Johannesburg to better understand the interaction of Soweto with the
                    South Africa’s dominant financial and commercial centre.</p></li>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-recommendations-for-the-orlando-east-project">Recommendations for the Orlando East
                Project</a></h2>

            <p>Our main concern is a level of disconnection between the ambitions of the project design and the
                practical resources on the ground. We suggest some possible areas for the project team to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A more targetted and strategic approach to partnering. We met with a number of partners, and no
                    doubt many more organisations have formal or informal relationships with World Vision in the area.
                    Careful assessment of the strengths and contributions of actual or prospective partners would
                    increase the chances of greater program impact. This may result in greater involvement with
                    partners, such as the SMME Forum and PlanAct, that are more directly involved in economic
                    development activities, and also have strong organisational capacities for facilitating this.
                    Project outputs could also be simplified to focus on what can be achieved through stronger – and
                    possibly financial – partnerships with these kinds of organisations.</p></li>
                <li><p>Related to this, we suggest possibly separating general World Vision community assistance from
                    its economic development work. Current staff seemed adept at separating these activities (and as we
                    note, in practice they are closely related in this context). However they do not seem to be formally
                    acknowledged, and complicate the project design.</p></li>
                <li><p>As we note, economic development is a highly complex field, and even more so given the other
                    challenges in this particular environment. We recommend that operational staff be supplemented by
                    research capacity in the areas of business, finance and economics – possibly through internships
                    from the University of Johannesburg. This could assist in identifying particular opportunities for
                    business and employment in the area.</p></li>
                <li><p>We also note the need of a more regular flow of information about programs, and consequently the
                    need to increase staff capacity to collect information on a regular basis between larger reviews.
                    Additional research capacity</p></li>
                <li><p>The aim of creating a self-sustaining partner network in the area is, in our view, currently
                    unrealistic. We suggest this either means extending the life of the pilot considerably, or examining
                    mechansisms, such as a consultancy or small non-government organisation, to take up the work
                    currently undertaken by World Vision. The latter option is unlikely to be productive without at
                    least some kind of ongoing support from World Vision itself.</p></li>
                <li><p>The link between economic development and child wellbeing is difficult to demonstrate, and to
                    measure, in any kind of realistic project 3-5 year timeframe. This poses the question of whether a
                    longer term plan needs to be defined, at least schematically. Such a plan could include transitional
                    arrangements, where specific World Vision-funded development projects could ‘spin-off’ to other
                    entities. Currently it is difficult to see who those entities might be in this area.</p></li>
                <li><p>Staff expressed concerns about the time and complexity of current processes for reporting and
                    budgeting. Given the nature of the work on this project, these concerns appeared well founded. We
                    recommend finding ways to allow for more flexible allocation of funds to support ‘soft’ development
                    work involved in partnering, facilitation and advocacy (covering various areas such as venue hire,
                    catering, transportation, communication, printing and so on).</p></li>
                <li><p>Associated with the previous point, it may be that current project management tools need to be
                    modified to fit the purpose and mode of engagement in the community. Moving forward, a key
                    contribution of this pilot could be the trialling of differential approaches to M&amp;E/financial
                    management that reflect the elements of facilitation, negotiation, relationship-building, and other
                    associated activities.</p></li>

            <h2><a href="#orlando-recommendations-for-the-review-methodology">Recommendations for the Review
                Methodology</a></h2>

            <p>We make the following recommendations for the methodological aspects of future reviews:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Continue with iterations of the current community, partner and staff instruments (including the
                    Partner Assessment Tool).</p></li>
                <li><p>Incorporate formal instructions for interviewers, plain language statements and consent
                    forms.</p></li>
                <li><p>Continue with the practice of ‘role-playing’ interviews on the first day of the review.</p></li>
                <li><p>Record interviews (and assess the usefulness of speech recognition software to convert interviews
                    to text).</p></li>
                <li><p>Separate ‘quant’ from ‘qual’ survey instruments, and conduct the quantitative surveys separately,
                    with larger cohorts.</p></li>
                <li><p>Terms like “community”, “government”, “partnership” and “project” should be anchored at the
                    outset of the interview (as well as clarified as much as possible at the start of the review
                    process). In practice we often clarified these terms, but not always in consistent ways. A
                    recommendation would be to have: A specific set of questions that asks the respondents to name their
                    “community”, their interaction with “government”, the nature of their “partnership” with World
                    Vision, and their knowledge of and interaction with the “project”.</p></li>
                <li>Include additional methods where appropriate, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Network mapping</li>
                        <li>Semi-structured observation (using “Walk&amp;Talk” or similar approaches)</li>
                        <li>Analysis of secondary materials, including published literature, statistical sources and
                            urban cultural forms (both before and after conducting field research)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p>Continue to examine methods for measuring impact and effectiveness of partnering, facilitation
                    and advocacy. One specific recommendation here is to develop an indicator of partner network
                    ‘maturity’–the extent to which a set of partnerships could survive without one or more
                    participants.</p></li>

            <p>While the framework as a whole provides a relevant spectrum of themes, questions and indicators, we
                recommend a broadening of the areas discussed in the area of <em>Urban Themes</em> particularly. This
                would enable a more flexibile theoretical instrument to guide the selection and adaptation of specific
                indicators and questions for reviews.</p>

            <p>We also recommend ongoing efforts to map broad trends in cities and urban literature to a coherent urban
                model. This would provide a means also for tying high level World Vision constructs such as the ‘Cities
                for Children’ through to specific review and evaluation instruments.</p>

            <p><strong>Q47</strong> What are the different types of community networks that exist in relation to this
                project?</p>

            <p><strong>Q48</strong> In relation to the most important of these networks, how would you describe World
                Vision ’s role (facilitator, broker, lead, etc.)? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q49</strong> How formal would you describe this network as being?</p>

            <p>[Note: If clarification is needed, suggest whether formal agreements or MOU’s are in place; whether there
                is a clear leadership and governance structure; whether there are regular meetings, reporting structures
                and so on]</p>

            <p><strong>Q50</strong> Did the community network or group exist before World Vision ’s involvement?</p>

            <p><strong>Q51</strong> If WV was removed today from the network, would it be self-sustaining? If so, why do
                you think this is? If not, why not?</p>

            <p>On a scale of 1-10, how effective would you say is World Vision in this role(s) (with 1 = very
                ineffective and 10 = very effective)?</p>

    <p><em>Introductory Questions</em></p>

    <p>What is the area in World Vision you work for?</p>

    <p>What is your role within World Vision?</p>

    <p>What is your relationship to the Orlando East project?</p>

    <p><em>Project Questions</em></p>

    <p>We would like to ask you a series of questions about the Orlando East project specifically.</p>

    <p>To begin with, could you describe the Orlando East project in your own words.</p>

    <p>What has been your role in relation to this project?</p>

    <p>When did you start in this role?</p>

    <p>What would you say have been the major achievements of the project to date?</p>

    <p>And what have been the greatest difficulties?</p>

    <p>What would you like to see happen in this project over the next 3-5 years?</p>

    <p>In a single sentence, what would you say is the main goal of this project?</p>

    <p>On a scale of 1-10, how much progress has been made towards achieving this goal?</p>

    <p>What are some specific hurdles or obstacles towards achieving the goal?</p>

    <p>Over the next 12-18 months, what specific activities would be most important for investing in, to realising the
        project goals and outcomes?</p>

    <p><em>Urban Themes</em></p>

    <p>In your experience with this project, what aspects of the urban environment have been particularly important - to
        its design, implementation and evaluation?</p>

    <p>How important a factor is the issue of mobility (people coming and going, migrating to and from the community) to
        this project? Please explain why.</p>

    <p>How important a factor is the issue of diversity (cultural, political, economic) to this project? Please explain
        why.</p>

    <p>Who would you say are the most vulnerable in the community targeted by this project? How would you say their
        needs are being met through the project?</p>

    <p>A key focus for urban programming has been partner and community networks. What are the key components to
        building strong networks in urban areas?</p>

    <p>Considering both World Vision itself, and the broader political environment, what would you say are the main
        challenges of governance with this project?</p>

    <p>In this project, there are a number of overlapping or “cross-cutting” themes: urban programming, child
        well-being, economic development, partnering, transformational development, and compliance with World Vision
        systems. Thinking generally, how well have you been able to mesh or integrate these themes in terms of
        day-to-day activity? Are there conflicts between these themes, and if so, please elaborate.</p>

    <p>In very general terms, how well do you think World Vision’s current systems and structures support urban
        programming aims? How could they be improved?</p>

    <p>These surveys can be administered in a number of ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As self-administered questionnaires (e.g. completed by the participant in writing or online)</li>
        <li>As prompting questions for semi-structured and key informant interviews</li>
        <li>As prompting questions for focus group discussions</li>
        <li>As guiding questions or themes for content analysis and statistical analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One purpose of the Orlando East Pilot Review will be to test these instruments and refine where necessary. Notes
        on difficulties interpreting or answering questions should therefore be kept during their administration.</p>

    <h2><a href="#orlando-interview-purpose-and-consent-form">Interview Purpose and Consent Form</a></h2>

    <p>Thank you for agreeing to talk with us about your involvement with the Orlando East urban project.</p>

    <p>We are researchers working with World Vision International to learn more about economic development in cities.
        World Vision of South Africa has been implementing a project in Orlando East since 2008, and we are conducting
        interviews to update our knowledge about this location and the important activities that can create economic
        opportunities for people living in informal settlements.</p>

    <p>During this interview we will ask a series of questions about Orlando East, about working in partnership with
        World Vision and about economic development in Johannesburg. This information will be used to improve our
        Orlando East project, and to help World Vision design better urban projects with people in other informal
        settlements around the world.</p>

    <p>We expect the interview will take approximately 1 hour. Of course you can withdraw at any point of the interview
        should you choose to do so.</p>

    <p>With your permission, a note taker will make a detailed record your responses for our research. The information
        will be available to the project team to be used to improve the project, and findings that emerge from these
        interviews may be used in publications internal and external to World Vision. We would also like to assure you
        that your confidentiality will be maintained. You will not be referred to by name in any reports, discussions or
        documents.</p>

    <p>In the next few weeks, when we are analysing all the interview responses, we may need to come back to you with
        follow up questions. Would you consent to this?</p>

    <p>Before we start, do you have any questions about the interview process? Do you consistent to continue with the
        interview and proceed with recording?</p>

    <p>This Urban Discovery Project (UDP) began in February 2008, with financial and technical support from World Vision
        Australia (WVA) and the Urban Programming Initiative (UPI)[@wvc2010baseline]. It is due to be completed in
        September, 2013.</p>

    <p>This project is one of six such discovery projects; the other five are located in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Orlando East, Johannesburg, South Africa</li>
        <li>Surabaya, Indonesia</li>
        <li>??, India</li>
        <li>Beirut, Lebanon</li>
        <li>La Paz, Bolivia</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All six projects have two key features that distinguish them for other WV projects: they are focused on urban
        areas, and they are issue-based. The six projects are being evaluated in 2012/13 as part of a ‘meta-evaluation’,
        seeking to address the first of these features: what makes cities different, as sites for aid and development
        assistance? This report is the second to be written as part of the meta-evaluation (the first report examines
        Orlando East). Part of it furthers a response to this question.</p>

    <p>The evaluation also addresses the particular issue of this project, the question of land security.</p>

    <div class="section level2" id="phnompenh-land-ownership-in-cambodia">
        <div class="section level2">
            <h2><a href="#phnompenh-land-ownership-in-cambodia">Land Ownership in Cambodia</a></h2>

            <p>Land is a concern in many developing contexts, due in part to the strong competing forces for land use.
                In rural settings, land contestation is frequently over <em>natural</em> resources. A recent WV
                evaluation of a land-based project, fortuitously also based in Cambodia, suggests land issues arise ‘as
                government owned state forest is being allocated for development to companies investing in cash crops,
                mining and agriculture’ [@wvc2012eval].</p>

            <p>In an urban context, land is valuable more due to the competing claims of diverse city inhabitants. These
                include business developers, keen on speculative investment; government departments of varied stripes
                (from local to national, and across different ministries and concerns); and urban communities, families,
                workers and residents, each with specific land interests and needs. <em>Land use</em>, accordingly, is
                also more diverse, with space needed for housing, places of work, transportation, recreation and
                commerce, as well as large-scale utility infrastructure for managing large populations: water provision,
                sewage, energy generation, waste. In this respect, there is arguably greater similarity between rich and
                poor cities, than poor cities and their surrounding rural environments. One key difference we focus on
                here is how land disputes are managed and resolved.</p>

            <p>The land question in Cambodia and Phnom Penh is especially complicated. Recent history is dominated by
                accounts of the 3 and a half year rule of the Khmer Rouge. In 1975 Phnom Penh was forcibly emptied, and
                land - both urban and rural - was appropriated by the state under a policy of brutal and near total
                agricultural collectivisation [cite]. In 1979, after the fall of the regime, people returned to Phnom
                Penh to reclaim, among other things, their property. In the decades since, Cambodia has seen communism
                give way to Vietnam-led socialism in the 80’s, followed by progressive - if slow - movement towards
                liberal capitalism and integration into the broader global economic and political community. Much of
                this transition has taken place under a nominal democracy, in practice presided over by the world’s
                longest serving prime minister, Hun Sen.</p>

            <p>Land reform has become a centerpiece of Sen’s government in the 2000’s.</p>

            <p>The evaluation followed a qualitative approach, comprising mainly of a series of informant interviews
                with community members, government officials, partner NGOs and World Vision staff. The interviews were
                conducted March 4-9, 2013, and were semi-structured. Interviews were supplemented by unstructured
                observation during the week, and by desk research. Each of these activities are described in further
                detail below.</p>

            <p>The evaluation was conducted by three WVA staff and one external consultant from RMIT University. Remy
                Herbert represented the UPI group; Julie Smith has had extensive experience with other World Vision
                Cambodian projects; and Nicki ? has a general background in legal and aid issues. Liam Magee is an urban
                researcher, and has been involved in the Orlando East review.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#phnompenh-interviews">Interviews</a></h3>

                    <p>Interview participants were pre-arranged by the World Vision Cambodian team. 49 interviews were
                        conducted in total, covering 4 interview groups:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community Members (25)</li>
                        <li>Partners (6)</li>
                        <li>Government Officials (7)</li>
                        <li>World Vision Staff (9)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Interviews were semi-structured. Pre-formed questions covered both specific facets of land rights
                        and security, and more general urban themes. In the latter case, questions were guided by the
                        <em>Urban Meta-analysis Framework</em> <span class="citation">(World Vision Centre of Expertise for Urban Programming 2012)</span>,
                        a set of general themes grouped under three broad categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Urban Context</li>
                        <li>Enabling Environment</li>
                        <li>Organisational Setting [?]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The same framework, and many of the same questions were employed in the Orlando East report. They
                        are likely to be employed in future evaluations, to allow for some level of comparability, as
                        part of a more general ‘meta-analysis’. To a degree, these questions and underlying themes are
                        ‘works-in- progress’ - aspects of these are considered in greater depth in the “Urban” section
                        of our analysis and recommendations.</p>

                    <p>Four sets of interview questions had been previously prepared and send to the Cambodian office
                        for translation. However questions were frequently adapted to suit the circumstances and
                        direction of individual interviews, requiring on-the-spot translation of both questions and
                        responses. Community and government interviews were largely conducted in a combination of Khmer
                        and English; partner and staff interviews were mostly in English only.</p>

                                interviewed. Sampling from these communities was generally done by convenience; though
                                community leaders featured prominently.</p>

                                remaining 5 belonged to WVC ADP or national office. In these cases, interviews departed
                                more regularly from the script: partly to allow us to probe more deeply into specific
                                areas of staff expertise and opinion, partly to ensure we could gain a more rounded
                                picture than a single set of questions might do. As a methodological aside, the same
                                approach had been adopted in the Orlando East review, and we recommend the same approach
                                be used in future urban evaluations.</p>

                    <p>For reasons we note under ‘Limitations’ below, interviews provided important but partial insights
                        into the achievements of the project. To supplement primary data collection, we reviewed recent
                        literature on Cambodia and Phnom Penh. Time limitations prevented this from being systematic;
                        however given the complexity of the land issue, and the more generally vexed question of NGO
                        engagement in Cambodia, a summary and discussion of this literature is included in this
                        report.</p>

            <p>Overall, our team’s conclusions broadly align from those of the baseline report [@wvc2010baseline]. The
                report authors claimed the UDP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>had been successful in empowering ‘communities to lead their own development and increase tenure
                    security’, but, as noted by partners, there are ‘limits to the successes of the UDP… as the forces
                    arrayed against it are too numerous’.</p></li>
                <li><p>had also successfully built relationships with other NGOs and with government, particularly at
                    the Sangkat level.</p></li>
                <li><p>had worked extremely well as an innovative learning ‘cell’ within World Vision.</p></li>
                <li><p>needs greater support from ‘World Vision systems’, which ‘run contrary to the work that UDP is
                    conducting’.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Three years later, these same observations remain true. However there are other observations that could
                now be added to the mix on the basis of our findings.</p>

            <p>Given the state of the UDP project, our recommendations also depart significantly from the baseline
                report. Principally they differ in terms of generality: there seems little point to specific
                programmatic recommendations, whereas the broader questions of how to leverage the UDP “experience” in
                the current Cambodian seems highly relevant.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>The issue of land rights is a national one. Currently efforts to reform land rights are
                            underway, in response to widespread dissatisfaction among both urban and rural populations.
                            However Phnom Penh forms only approximately 15% of the Cambodian population, while the
                            question of land, as discussed above, is considerably more contentious. Current efforts to
                            register land are therefore focussed on rural land rights - both a larger voting bloc to
                            appease, and presumably, concerns that are easier to remedy. This politically-informed
                            choice is probably the single biggest obstacle to the resolution of land registration for
                            the 15 urban communities involved in this project.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The project is scheduled for completion in late 2013; however the land issue will not be
                            resolved for these communities. While the communities appear to have taken on a degree of
                            autonomous communication - with eachother, with government and with other partners - World
                            Vision remains a central participant in this network. This raises a broader question (also
                            evident in Orlando East) about how UDPs plan for and execute an effective exit strategy.
                            Difficult to quantify, at least some of the gains would be lost if the UDP wound up for good
                            at this stage.</p></li>
                        <li><p>From many of the interviews, there was a clear expectation from communities that the
                            government would eventually resolve the land issue - though not necessarily in their favour.
                            It is less clear what the ‘Plan B’ might be: would these communities simply dissipate? Would
                            they be sufficiently compensated, and on what basis? Could the community survive, even if
                            transplanted to another location? What provision would be made for employment, education and
                            other service delivery in that event?</p></li>
                        <li>The UDP is rightly focused on the needs of the communities it is assisting. However Phnom
                            Penh has many other stakeholders with at least indirectly competing needs. Even partial
                            exposure to the project made the evaluation team acutely aware of heavy economic and social
                            activity in areas immediately approximate to the project communities. Over time, competition
                            for land
                        </li>
                        <li><p>in the form of higher rents and lower availability - will inevitably increase.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Cambodia’s economy has been growing steadily, with GDP per capita (PPP) growing at an
                            average of 9% per annum for the past decade. This is largely fueled by garment and natural
                            resource exports, with a smaller slice made up by tourism. A tentative conclusion based on
                            growth in manufacturing and service sectors is that the current urban composition (15%) will
                            also grow. As in other east Asian cities, this is only likely to exacerbate pressures on
                            existing urban land usage. It is likely that the most disadvantaged under these conditions
                            will not be relatively settled and secure communities, but new urban poor workers looking
                            for opportunities on the fringes of Phnom Penh. These of course could include members of
                            resettled communities targeted by this project, alongside rural migrants.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Land rights in Phnom Penh is likely to be an ongoing issue, both for these communities
                            and incoming migrants. The UDP has developed important skills and relationships. <em>These
                                should be used to help address land and other emerging issues</em>, either through a
                            modified ongoing UDP project, or as part of more general ADP work in Phnom Penh.</p></li>
                        <li><p>There are signs that as Cambodia’s economy grows in manufacturing and service sectors,
                            Phnom Penh, as the only large-scale urban settlement, will bear the brunt of internal
                            economic migration. Similarly the land reforms will eventually migrate to Phnom Penh,
                            creating resolution in some cases, and potentially confusion and dislocation in others. <em>The
                                UDP offers a organisational vehicle where city-wide impacts of broader economic and
                                political change can be monitored and addressed</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>In the event that the UDP continues, we suggest <em>a greater focus on developing -
                            through partnerships or recruitment - legal and urban planning expertise, as well as access
                            to more and differentiated levels of government and business</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The urban context itself is somewhat underplayed in available project documents. The
                            urban location provides both positives and negatives: greater access to different levels of
                            government and diverse partners, for example, but also a greater number of public and
                            private interests to satisfy, as well as (obviously) higher density in and of itself
                            creating higher demand for land. <em>Given the “pilot” status of this project, greater
                                attention to its “urban” character would help outside parties (including evaluators)
                                understand how it differs (and needs to differ) from other development projects</em>.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>Specifically, the UDP should <em>engage more directly with those actors who have other
                            uses for the land where these communities reside</em>. This would provide both more
                            realistic expectations for the communities themselves, and offer further avenues for
                            advocacy.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Despite economic growth, gradual democratic form and increased global engagement,
                            Cambodia still rates very poorly in terms of transparency.<sup><a
                                    href="#phnompenh-fn1">1</a></sup> Even in the most transparent of government
                            regimes, land and urban planning sees relatively high levels of corruption at local and
                            state levels of government. It is not surprising therefore that we received anecdotal
                            evidence that corruption plays a major role in settling land issues in Phnom Penh. Relations
                            with government - at all levels - need to be handled extremely sensitively in light of this.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>We also note the importance of a major international NGO contributing to this
                            controversial and political issue. World Vision’s very presence - almost irrespective of its
                            effectiveness - provides an important counterweight to the strong commercial and political
                            interests invested in land issues.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A clear difficulty of the project is the dependency upon government actions. Greater
                            certainty over the time lines the government has forecast for resolving urban land rights
                            would reduce uncertainty among the communities.</p></li>
                        <li><p>There are more than 400 NGOs operating in Cambodia as a whole. With a project as large
                            and diffuse as urban land rights, partnering is vital: to make sure that different NGO
                            strengths are used effectively, and to minimise conflict and duplication of effort. Project
                            partners were broadly complimentary of World Vision’s efforts in this regard. However some
                            felt World Vision lacked the flexibility and expertise to address the complexities of land
                            rights effectively.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Specifically, two smaller NGO partners - CMDP and UPWD - are of critical importance to
                            the project’s ongoing viability.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Much of the work of the UDP focuses on “three planks” of partnering, facilitation and
                            advocacy. The actual work of staff appeared far more focused on partnering and facilitation.
                            While the government officials we met with expressed a high regard for World Vision’s work,
                            it wasn’t clear what actual advocacy work had been planned or carried out. “Soft advocacy”
                            appears to be indirect, through the agency of the communities.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>From the literature, “soft advocacy” appears a relatively ‘soft’ concept, capable of many
                            interpretations. Given its significance to both this and other ADPs, we recommend a more
                            direct focus on practical advocacy work training, guidelines and methods of monitoring
                            performance. <em>The UDP network within World Vision - as well as strategic NGO partners
                                with expertise in this area - could help develop such guidelines</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Government relations in Cambodia are complex, and require specific skills. Aside from the
                            project leader, it is unclear who in the UDP (or elsewhere in the organisation) might
                            provide those skills. <em>More attention to higher level advocacy skills is recommended to
                                address this</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Similarly, it has not always been clear what soft advocacy activity is <em>for</em>. At
                            this stage, one feasible outcome would be <em>definitive timelines on when the government
                                plans to resolve urban land rights</em>. This could drive advocacy over the remaining
                            months of the project, and help provide greater clarity for communities to plan for future
                            advocacy work on their own behalf.</p></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Partners, government officials, and internal UDP and ADP staff all spoke very generally
                            of the benefits the UDP had delivered to World Vision Cambodia as a whole. Quite
                            independently of the specific benefits of the project’s urban and land issue focus, having
                            models that encourage programming and procedural experimentation and innovation appears to
                            be highly beneficial.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The urban focus of this project was hard for both World Vision staff and the evaluation
                            to articulate. This is in part due to the fact that “urban” is partly synonymous with the
                            issue focus of this (and other) UDPs. As one of the evaluation team put it, there is
                            relatively little difference between the actual activities of this urban project, compared
                            with other issue-based projects (urban or otherwise). That is perhaps not surprising given
                            the issue of land is pertinent to both urban and rural settings (particularly in Cambodia at
                            this time).</p></li>
                        <li><p>Several of the partners felt World Vision is somewhat rigid as an organisation,
                            particularly in relation to expenditure and allocation of responsibilities to project
                            activities. This is a concern in a dynamic and fast-changing urban context especially.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>Much of the purported work of the UDP focusses on “three planks” of partnering,
                            facilitation and advocacy. The actual work of staff appeared far more focussed on partnering
                            and facilitation. While the government officials we met with expressed a high regard for
                            World Vision’s work, it wasn’t clear what actual advocacy work had been planned or carried
                            out. “Soft advocacy” appears to be indirect, through the agency of the communities.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Methodologically, the mix of World Vision and external staff proved useful. However it
                            would be useful to clarify - for all members of the evaluation team - what is meant by
                            evaluation in the UDP pilot project context. It is clear for instance that currently the UDP
                            projects (in both Orlando East and Phnom Penh) are difficult to evaluate in ordinary terms,
                            in spite of the presence of baseline reports. This is for several reasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>the six different projects focus on different issues, with different resourcing
                                    levels and very different social, economic and political contexts. Comparing <em>across</em>
                                    these contexts is extremely difficult, without at least (a) a similar project design
                                    and (b) similar resourcing levels.</p></li>
                                <li><p>without quantitative indicators, it is also difficult to evaluate change over
                                    time in a given project context. For example, we have similar conclusions to the
                                    2010 baseline report, but not a clear sense of what exact progress has been made
                                    since then. Consequently it is also difficult to evaluate the project <em>over
                                        time</em>.</p></li>
                                <li><p>the project is one of six UDP pilots. <em>Evaluation</em> in that context means,
                                    arguably, something more qualitative, constructivist and exploratory than what would
                                    usually be understood by the term.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Future UDP projects should be more focused, both in terms of goals / outcomes / outputs
                            and, more importantly, the steps for implementation. This is particularly important given
                            the social character of this kind of work (partnering, facilitation, advocacy, etc). Though
                            difficult, some concrete guidelines and indicators could help bind these activities
                            conceptually to project outcomes and outputs.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Related to the previous recommendation: both the Orlando East and Phnom Penh cases suffer
                            something of a disconnect between the “high level” aspirational language of baseline and
                            project design reports, and what appears to be the concrete work done by project teams. This
                            is natural given the pilot nature of both cases. However <em>future UDP projects would
                                benefit from a more streamlined level of connectivity between various World Vision
                                frameworks and processes (child wellbeing indicators, LEAP language), and
                                project-specific activities</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>UDP projects should have smaller timeframes and more flexible allocations of
                            resources</em>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Risk management needs greater refinement</em>. The project goal is heavily dependent
                            upon government action, which is naturally subject to other influences. Adverse government
                            actions, in particular, need specific mitigation strategies.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For future UDPs, <em>evaluation should be both more frequent (perhaps annual) and utilise
                            a greater range of mixed methods, to get a greater diversity of data on key indicators</em>
                            (once the indicators themselves are clearer).</p></li>

            <h3><a href="#phnompenh-framework-questions-1">Framework Questions</a></h3>

            <p>These questions relate to the theme of the Partner Network.</p>

            <p><strong>Q30</strong> What are the different types of partnerships that exist in this project? Types of
                partnerships could include strategic alliances, networks, contractual arrangements or informal
                agreements, for example.</p>

            <p><strong>Q31</strong> Do you think partnerships have been actively working together to achieve collective
                goals? If so, could you provide an example *.</p>

            <p><strong>Q32</strong> Would you describe these partnerships as “equitable”? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q33</strong> What are the most important elements of a good partnership? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q34</strong> To what extent do partners share or co-fund resources in this project?</p>

            <p><strong>Q35</strong> What financing arrangements have been suitable to work done through the partnership?
            </p>

            <p><strong>Q36</strong> To what extent do you think that these financial arrangements affect the equity of
                partner relations?</p>

            <p><strong>Q37</strong> How clearly defined do you think the roles and responsibilities are in this project?
            </p>

            <p><strong>Q38</strong> Would you say that planning processes are collaborative between project partners? *
            </p>

            <p><strong>Q39</strong> Have there frequent partnership meetings to discuss challenges and issues? How
                frequent are these?</p>

            <p><strong>Q40</strong> Have Monitoring &amp; Evaluation strategies been agreed upon between partners? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q42</strong> How would you describe the relationships between various organisations and partners
                within the partnership network currently?</p>

            <p><strong>Q43</strong> We will now ask you a series of statements regarding your partnership with World
                Vision. We would like you to respond by indicating your level of agreement with each of these
                statements, using one of 5 options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strongly Agree</li>
                <li>Agree</li>
                <li>Neither Agree nor Disagree</li>
                <li>Disagree</li>
                <li>Strongly Disagree</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are 35 statements in all. If you would like to be reminded of these options at any time, please let
                us know. [Administer Partnership Assessment Tool]</p>

            <p>We will now continue with further questions regarding networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Q45</strong> How has World Vision facilitated the capacity building of the partner network? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q46</strong> How is World Vision preparing network partners for future financial autonomy?</p>

            <p><strong>Q47</strong> What are the different types of community networks that exist in relation to this
                project?</p>

            <p><strong>Q48</strong> In relation to the most important of these networks, how would you describe World
                Vision ’s role (facilitator, broker, lead, etc.)? *</p>

            <p><strong>Q49</strong> How formal would you describe this network as being?</p>

            <p>[Note: If clarification is needed, suggest whether formal agreements or MOU’s are in place; whether there
                is a clear leadership and governance structure; whether there are regular meetings, reporting structures
                and so on]</p>

            <p><strong>Q50</strong> Did the community network or group exist before World Vision ’s involvement?</p>

            <p><strong>Q51</strong> If WV was removed today from the network, would it be self-sustaining? If so, why do
                you think this is? If not, why not?</p>

            <p>On a scale of 1-10, how effective would you say is World Vision in this role(s) (with 1 = very
                ineffective and 10 = very effective)?</p>

    <p><em>Introductory Questions</em></p>

    <p>What is the area in World Vision you work for?</p>

    <p>What is your role within World Vision?</p>

    <p>What is your relationship to the Orlando East project?</p>

    <p><em>Project Questions</em></p>

    <p>We would like to ask you a series of questions about the Orlando East project specifically.</p>

    <p>To begin with, could you describe the Orlando East project in your own words.</p>

    <p>What has been your role in relation to this project?</p>

    <p>When did you start in this role?</p>

    <p>What would you say have been the major achievements of the project to date?</p>

    <p>And what have been the greatest difficulties?</p>

    <p>What would you like to see happen in this project over the next 3-5 years?</p>

    <p>In a single sentence, what would you say is the main goal of this project?</p>

    <p>On a scale of 1-10, how much progress has been made towards achieving this goal?</p>

    <p>What are some specific hurdles or obstacles towards achieving the goal?</p>

    <p>Over the next 12-18 months, what specific activities would be most important for investing in, to realising the
        project goals and outcomes?</p>

    <p><em>Urban Themes</em></p>

    <p>In your experience with this project, what aspects of the urban environment have been particularly important - to
        its design, implementation and evaluation?</p>

    <p>How important a factor is the issue of mobility (people coming and going, migrating to and from the community) to
        this project? Please explain why.</p>

    <p>How important a factor is the issue of diversity (cultural, political, economic) to this project? Please explain
        why.</p>

    <p>Who would you say are the most vulnerable in the community targeted by this project? How would you say their
        needs are being met through the project?</p>

    <p>A key focus for urban programming has been partner and community networks. What are the key components to
        building strong networks in urban areas?</p>

    <p>Considering both World Vision itself, and the broader political environment, what would you say are the main
        challenges of governance with this project?</p>

    <p>In this project, there are a number of overlapping or “cross-cutting” themes: urban programming, child
        well-being, economic development, partnering, transformational development, and compliance with World Vision
        systems. Thinking generally, how well have you been able to mesh or integrate these themes in terms of
        day-to-day activity? Are there conflicts between these themes, and if so, please elaborate.</p>

    <p>In very general terms, how well do you think World Vision’s current systems and structures support urban
        programming aims? How could they be improved?</p>

    <p>These surveys can be administered in a number of ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As self-administered questionnaires (e.g. completed by the participant in writing or online)</li>
        <li>As prompting questions for semi-structured and key informant interviews</li>
        <li>As prompting questions for focus group discussions</li>
        <li>As guiding questions or themes for content analysis and statistical analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One purpose of the Orlando East Pilot Review will be to test these instruments and refine where necessary. Notes
        on difficulties interpreting or answering questions should therefore be kept during their administration.</p>

    <h2><a href="#phnompenh-interview-purpose-and-consent-form">Interview Purpose and Consent Form</a></h2>

    <p>Thank you for agreeing to talk with us about your involvement with the Orlando East urban project.</p>

    <p>We are researchers working with World Vision International to learn more about economic development in cities.
        World Vision of South Africa has been implementing a project in Orlando East since 2008, and we are conducting
        interviews to update our knowledge about this location and the important activities that can create economic
        opportunities for people living in informal settlements.</p>

    <p>During this interview we will ask a series of questions about Orlando East, about working in partnership with
        World Vision and about economic development in Johannesburg. This information will be used to improve our
        Orlando East project, and to help World Vision design better urban projects with people in other informal
        settlements around the world.</p>

    <p>We expect the interview will take approximately 1 hour. Of course you can withdraw at any point of the interview
        should you choose to do so.</p>

    <p>With your permission, a note taker will make a detailed record your responses for our research. The information
        will be available to the project team to be used to improve the project, and findings that emerge from these
        interviews may be used in publications internal and external to World Vision. We would also like to assure you
        that your confidentiality will be maintained. You will not be referred to by name in any reports, discussions or
        documents.</p>

    <p>In the next few weeks, when we are analysing all the interview responses, we may need to come back to you with
        follow up questions. Would you consent to this?</p>

    <p>Before we start, do you have any questions about the interview process? Do you consistent to continue with the
        interview and proceed with recording?</p>
